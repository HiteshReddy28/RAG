USCIS will resume approvals for eligible principal petitions on October 1, 2025, prioritizing those filed on or before April 30, 2017.\n\nUSCIS has implemented a \"bona fide determination process\" to expedite reviews of pending U nonimmigrant status petitions. This process, initiated on June 14, 2021, aims to provide eligible victims with employment authorization and deferred action while they await final adjudication. This process applies to U.S.-based principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending petitions as of June 14, 2021, or filed thereafter.\n\nThe bona fide determination is first made for the principal petitioner. A petition is considered bona fide if it's properly filed, includes a law enforcement certification, a personal statement, and results of background checks. Eligibility for a bona fide determination also depends on whether the petitioner merits a favorable exercise of discretion. Qualifying family members are only considered for a bona fide determination after the principal petitioner receives one.\n\nPetitioners are encouraged to file Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization) concurrently with their Form I-918 or I-918A. There is no fee for an initial bona fide determination EAD or for an EAD based on waiting list placement. Petitioners who do not receive a bona fide determination EAD may be eligible for waiting list review. Initial bona fide determination EADs and grants of deferred action are valid for 4 years and can generally be renewed.\n\nThe bona fide determination process does not alter the role of certifying officials. USCIS has also suspended a streamlined adjudication process for certain petitions as of February 4, 2025, reverting to standard review processes for petitions with complex factors.

The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90) further reformed the system by increasing immigrant visas and restructuring preferences into family-sponsored, employment-based, and diversity categories. IMMACT 90 also shifted naturalization from judicial to administrative processes, with Federal Naturalization Examiners now making decisions.

While service members still needed to demonstrate good moral character and allegiance to the U.S., they were not automatically granted citizenship. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) managed stateside naturalizations, facilitating paperwork and organizing swearing-in ceremonies, sometimes on military bases.\n\nThe 1942 act also authorized the first overseas naturalizations, allowing designated representatives to naturalize service members abroad, bypassing the need for open court. INS officials, along with representatives from the State Department and U.S. District Attorney’s Office, conducted these. Thomas B. Shoemaker was the first to perform an overseas naturalization in the Panama Canal Zone in 1942. Henry B. Hazard naturalized the most service members overseas, traveling extensively between 1943 and 1945.

In 1965, amendments replaced the quota system with a preference system prioritizing family reunification and skilled workers, reflecting a shift in immigration sources from Europe to Asia and the Americas.

Gaps in DACA status may occur if a renewal is not processed before the current grant expires, and renewed DACA is not retroactive.\n*   **Information Sharing:** Information provided for DACA requests will not alone make an individual an immigration priority for removal.

This ensures families have consistent ethical standards regardless of the country of adoption.\n\nThe UAA impacts various aspects of orphan adoption processes, including:\n\n*   **Home Study Preparation:** Home studies must be conducted by authorized individuals and comply with updated regulations. The ASP is responsible for ensuring the child's country of origin receives the same home study.\n*   **Definitions:** New definitions for key terms related to adoption are outlined in relevant regulations.\n*   **Duty of Disclosure:** Applicants, their spouses, and adult household members have an ongoing duty to disclose information throughout the adoption process.\n*   **Identifying a Primary Provider:** Form I-600 petitioners must identify a primary provider responsible for ensuring all required adoption services are met and for supervising any other providers. Only accredited or approved entities can serve as primary providers. Evidence of this relationship, such as a letter or service plan, is required.\n\nWhile individuals can act on their own behalf, they still generally need an accredited or approved primary provider.\n\n**UAA Grandfathering:** Cases initiated before July 13, 2013, by filing Form I-600A, Form I-600, or an appropriate foreign application, are \"UAA-grandfathered.\" This means ASPs in these cases do not need accreditation or approval, even for services provided after July 14, 2014. For cases not grandfathered, ASPs must be accredited or approved for services rendered on or after July 14, 2014.\n\n**Form I-600A Approvals:** A UAA-grandfathered Form I-600A approval is valid for the number of children approved before July 14, 2014. Any increase in the number of children to be adopted after this date generally falls under the UAA, with exceptions for birth siblings.

This form is for individuals born abroad who claim citizenship through their parents, or those who became U.S. citizens by law after birth but before age 18. It is not for those born in the U.S. The death of a U.S. citizen parent does not necessarily affect one's ability to apply if citizenship was acquired before their death.\n\nThe requirements for automatically acquiring citizenship through a parent vary, especially for those born out of wedlock. If claiming citizenship through a mother, the key factors include her U.S. presence before birth and, for acquisitions after birth, the child's age and residency. For citizenship through a father, specific requirements regarding his U.S. presence, acknowledgment of paternity, and legitimation apply, with variations based on birth dates. Divorce of parents generally doesn't impact citizenship acquisition if it occurred after citizenship was automatically granted.\n\nResiding abroad typically means seeking evidence of citizenship through a passport from the Department of State, rather than Form N-600. However, exceptions exist for children under 18 present in the U.S. under lawful admission, who may apply for naturalization via Form N-600K.\n\nA U.S. passport is generally sufficient proof of citizenship, making Form N-600 optional. However, a Certificate of Citizenship may be required for certain benefits like Social Security, state IDs, financial aid, employment, and passport renewal.\n\nInterviews are not always required for Form N-600. If an interview is necessary, applicants must bring original documents and certified translations for any non-English documents. Applicants 18 or older can attend without a U.S. citizen parent; those under 18 must attend with a parent unless waived.\n\nIf Form N-600 is approved, a Certificate of Citizenship is issued. Applicants over 14 may need to take an Oath of Allegiance. If denied, an appeal can be filed using Form I-290B within 30 days. After the appeal period, a new Form N-600 will be rejected, and a motion to reopen or reconsider must be filed on Form I-290B.",

Special rules apply for children born out of wedlock, adopted children, and orphans.

      "summary": "Forced marriage is defined as a marriage involving elements of force, fraud, or coercion, where one or both parties cannot or do not consent. Consent means giving full, free, and informed agreement to the marriage and its timing. This practice can occur regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, immigration status, economic or educational background, and may involve physical or emotional abuse, threats, or deception. Signs of forced marriage include feeling a lack of choice in spouse or timing, facing threats of abandonment or abuse if refusing or leaving the marriage, fear of consequences for saying \"no\" (including harm to oneself or family), being monitored to prevent seeking help, feeling obligated to marry or stay married to avoid shame or harm, having travel documents or money withheld, and believing refusal to marry could lead to harm or death for oneself or loved ones.\n\nArranged marriage, where families help choose partners but individuals retain the freedom to consent, is distinct from forced marriage, which denies individuals the ultimate choice. While both forced marriage and human trafficking are forms of abuse, they are separate. The U.S. government opposes forced marriage, viewing it as a human rights abuse and child abuse when involving minors, and is working to end the practice and assist victims.\n\nIn some U.S. states, forced marriage is a crime, and perpetrators can face charges for related offenses like domestic violence, assault, and kidnapping, as well as immigration consequences. Victims are not at fault for entering a forced marriage. Those in or at risk of forced marriage can access legal aid, social services, safety planning, and legal remedies such as protection orders, annulment, or divorce.\n\nEmergency assistance can be obtained by calling 911. Confidential, 24/7 help is available through The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-SAFE) and the National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888). U.S. citizens abroad should contact their nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate. U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents forced to sponsor a spouse for immigration benefits can withdraw their petition, but should seek advice beforehand to ensure safety. Aliens forced into marriage or fearing forced marriage may be eligible for U.S. immigration relief, including asylum, SIJ classification, VAWA self-petition, waivers, T visas, and U visas. Resources for authorized immigration service providers are available. Additional information on forced marriage and human trafficking can be found through the U.S. Department of State, USAID, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign.",

Documents must appear genuine and relate to the presenter. Discrimination based on appearance or sound is prohibited.\n*   **Document authenticity:** Employers must examine original documents and accept them if they reasonably appear genuine and relate to the person.

While some general naturalization requirements apply, others are reduced or waived. Key requirements include being 18 or older, honorable service, providing appropriate service documentation (Form N-426 or discharge papers), demonstrating honorable separation (if not currently serving), being a lawful permanent resident at the time of the interview, meeting certain residence and physical presence rules, English and civics proficiency (unless waived), demonstrating good moral character, and attachment to U.S. constitutional principles.\n\n**INA 329:** For those who served honorably during designated periods of hostilities. This pathway offers greater flexibility, often waiving continuous residence and physical presence requirements. Service members must have served honorably during a designated period of hostility (listed in the document), have appropriate service documentation, and meet specific residency or physical presence criteria at the time of enlistment/induction (e.g., in the U.S., Canal Zone, American Samoa, or on a U.S. public vessel). English and civics proficiency, good moral character, and attachment to U.S. principles are also required, though waivers may apply.\n\n**General Application Process:**\n\n*   **Forms:** File Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. If currently serving, also file Form N-426. If separated, provide discharge documents (DD Form 214, NGB Form 22, etc.). For posthumous citizenship, file Form N-644.\n*   **Fees:** Applications under INA 328 and 329 are fee-exempt.\n*   **Filing:** Applications can be mailed to a specific USCIS P.O. Box in Chicago or filed online through a USCIS online account.\n*   **Biometrics:** Fingerprinting will be required, which can be done using previous prints, through specific procedures abroad, or at an Application Support Center (ASC) in the U.S. (where prior or current military service must be presented).\n*   **Interview:** Applicants will have an interview at a USCIS field office to review eligibility and test English and civics knowledge.\n*   **Oath of Allegiance:** Upon approval, applicants will take the Oath of Allegiance to become a U.S. citizen. Those applying based on military service during hostilities must complete this process in the U.S.\n*   **Assistance:** USCIS liaisons are available on many military installations to help with the application process. A Military Help Line is also available for inquiries.\n\n**Posthumous Citizenship (INA 329A):**\n\n*   For service members who died as a result of injury or disease incurred/aggravated during honorable service in a designated period of hostilities.\n*   Form N-644 must be filed within two years of death.\n*   Other immigration benefits may be available to surviving family members.\n\nThe document also provides links to additional resources, including USCIS Policy Manuals, fact sheets, and study materials for the English and civics tests.",

      "summary": "This document outlines USCIS procedures for handling feedback, complaints, misconduct, and discrimination.\n\n**Feedback:** USCIS collects feedback through surveys after interactions with the Contact Center, by allowing individuals to speak to supervisors during in-person appointments, and via an optional website survey. They also use usability testing and focus groups for website improvements.\n\n**Complaints:** Complaints can be submitted by speaking to a supervisor in USCIS offices, through written correspondence (letters, emails, faxes), directly to the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), or by contacting USCIS Headquarters. Dissatisfied callers to the Contact Center can request to speak to a supervisor. USCIS emphasizes that all complaints must be handled appropriately, with a written or verbal response explaining actions taken or expected resolution timelines. Complaints about the unauthorized practice of immigration law are directed to USCIS's website for state-specific reporting information.\n\n**Misconduct:** USCIS employees and contractors are subject to reporting requirements for known or suspected misconduct. This includes fraud, corruption, bribery, sexual misconduct, theft, perjury, physical assault, unauthorized release of information, drug use, misuse of databases or official positions, misuse of government property or cards, falsification of documents, and more. Allegations should be reported promptly to a USCIS supervisor, USCIS Office of Investigations (OI), or DHS OIG. Discriminatory conduct can also be reported to the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL). USCIS OI aims to maintain confidentiality but may need to disclose information during disciplinary actions.\n\n**Discrimination:** USCIS prohibits all forms of discriminatory treatment, including retaliation against those who report or participate in discrimination investigations. This policy applies to all interactions, regardless of whether the protected class is specifically defined by federal law. Training is provided to employees on the anti-discrimination policy. Allegations of discrimination (based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, disability, etc.) should be reported promptly to a USCIS supervisor, DHS CRCL, USCIS OI, or DHS OIG. Physical assault allegations should be reported to OI or DHS OIG.\n\n**Fraud, Abuse, and Scams:** Information on reporting fraud, abuse, and scams is available on the USCIS Contact Us page. Other avenues for reporting immigration fraud include ICE, the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division, the Federal Trade Commission, and state authorities. The USCIS website also provides information on common scams.\n\n**Updates:** The document also lists several technical and policy updates to the USCIS Policy Manual, including changes related to website conformity, terminology (\"alien\" vs. \"noncitizen\"), fee schedule alignment, and incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content.",

IRCA introduced the Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9) to ensure all employees can prove their legal right to work.

It categorizes eligibility into three main classes: authorization for any employer, authorization for a specific employer, and authorization upon USCIS approval.\n\n**Aliens Authorized to Work for Any Employer Based on Status or Circumstances:**\n\n*   **Must Apply for Documentation:** Certain aliens, including refugees, certain Afghan and Ukrainian parolees, K-1/K-2 visa holders, parents/children of LPRs from international organizations, Palauan citizens, those granted withholding of deportation, aliens under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, Family Unity Program beneficiaries, V nonimmigrants, and CNMI residents, must apply to USCIS for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) using Form I-765.\n*   **Do Not Need to Apply:** Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), lawful temporary residents, asylees, citizens of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands, K-3/K-4 visa holders, victims of severe trafficking (T-1), spouses of principal E nonimmigrants, spouses of principal L-1 nonimmigrants, and victims of qualifying criminal activity (U-1) and their family members (U-2 to U-5) generally do not need to apply for an EAD as their existing documentation serves as proof of authorization. However, they must still present acceptable documents for identity and employment authorization. Specific documentation requirements are outlined for LPRs and others who may use their Form I-94.\n\n**Aliens Authorized to Work for a Specific Employer Based on Status or Circumstances:**\n\n*   This category includes various nonimmigrants and parolees who automatically receive work authorization incident to their status for a specific employer. Examples include foreign government officials, treaty traders/investors, certain students (F-1) with specific employment types (on-campus, CPT, STEM OPT, H-1B extension), representatives of international organizations, temporary workers (H-1, H-2, H-3), representatives of foreign media, exchange visitors (J-1), intra-company transferees (L-1), aliens of extraordinary ability (O-1), athletes/artists/entertainers (P-1 to P-3), cultural exchange visitors (Q-1), religious workers (R-1), NATO civilian employees, USMCA professionals (TN), temporary workers with filed petitions, CNMI investors/workers, \"nonimmigrant treaty aliens\" in specialty occupations (E-3), and entrepreneurs paroled. These individuals do not need to file Form I-765 but are restricted to employment with the specified employer.\n\n**Aliens Required to Apply for Employment Authorization:**\n\n*   This group is not automatically authorized to work and must apply to USCIS for an EAD. This includes spouses/dependents of foreign government officials (A-1/A-2) with State Department endorsement, spouses/dependents of TECRO employees (E-1), F-1 students seeking pre-completion OPT, STEM OPT extensions, employment sponsorship by international organizations, or those facing severe economic hardship. It also includes spouses/dependents of international organization representatives (G-1, G-3, G-4), spouses/minor children of exchange visitors (J-2), M-1 students seeking practical training, dependents of NATO-1 to NATO-6 nonimmigrants, asylum applicants, adjustment of status applicants (INA 245), cancellation of removal applicants, most parolees (with specific exceptions), spouses of CNMI investors (E-2), aliens granted deferred action, registry applicants, certain B-1 visitors (personal/domestic servants, foreign airline employees), applicants with final deportation/removal orders, applicants with pending TPS, special agricultural worker applicants, witnesses/informants (S nonimmigrants), legalization applicants (INA 245A), LIFE Act applicants, derivative T visa family members, spouses of certain H-1B nonimmigrants, VAWA self-petitioners, spouses of entrepreneur parolees, and principal beneficiaries of approved I-140 facing compelling circumstances and their dependents.

      "summary": "Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual, \"Adjudication,\" details the process for reviewing and deciding on Applications for Employment Authorization (Form I-765). Upon acceptance, USCIS verifies the applicant's identity, immigration status, and eligibility for employment authorization. This includes checking for proper fee payment, fee waivers, or exemptions. If the eligibility category is unclear, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE).\n\nKey aspects of the adjudication process include:\n\n*   **General Review:** USCIS ensures the application is complete and all required initial evidence is submitted.\n*   **Identity and Eligibility Verification:** These are common to all eligibility categories. Identity is verified, potentially requiring biometrics. Eligibility is confirmed by verifying the applicant meets the requirements of a specific category and has submitted supporting documents such as visas, Form I-94, or approval notices.\n*   **Discretionary Factors:** In many cases, especially those under 8 CFR 274a.12(c), employment authorization is granted at USCIS's discretion. Negative factors, such as supporting terrorist organizations, are considered overwhelmingly negative in discretionary analyses.\n*   **Decision:**\n    *   **Approval:** If identity and eligibility are established, and discretion is favorably exercised, the application is approved, and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is issued. The EAD itself does not grant immigration status but serves as proof of work authorization. Validity periods are determined by the eligibility category and may coincide with the applicant's underlying immigration status.\n    *   **Denial:** If identity cannot be verified, eligibility is not established, or the application is abandoned, USCIS denies the application and provides written notification of the reasons. There is no appeal, but a motion to reopen or reconsider can be filed.\n*   **Early Filing:** Renewals filed more than 180 days before expiration are generally not backdated or postdated.\n*   **Automatic Termination and Revocation:** Employment authorization can terminate automatically if eligibility ceases. Revocation requires a notice of intent to revoke (NOIR) if the application contained false statements, terms were violated, the basis for the EAD is no longer valid, or the approval was an error.\n*   **Withdrawing Application:** Applicants can withdraw their Form I-765 in writing before a final decision.\n*   **Motion to Reopen or Reconsider:** A motion to reopen or reconsider can be filed using Form I-290B within 30 days of denial.\n*   **Effect of Motion/Appeal:** Eligibility for employment authorization is generally maintained if an underlying application is still pending or if a timely appeal or motion to reopen is filed and remains pending.\n\nThe chapter also includes tables detailing various eligibility categories (under 8 CFR 274a.12) and their associated maximum initial and renewal validity periods, as well as resources, appendices (none available), and updates to policy guidance.

New Class of Admission (COA) codes (E-1S, E-2S, E-3S, L-2S) on their Form I-94, issued from January 30, 2022, onwards, serve as evidence of this authorization. For Forms I-94 issued before this date, a USCIS notice combined with the I-94 showing specific nonimmigrant statuses (E-1, E-2, E-3, E-3D, E-3R, or L-2) is acceptable as proof of employment authorization.\n\nE and L spouses can still apply for an EAD. The validity period of an EAD is generally aligned with the Form I-94 expiration date, not exceeding two years for E and L spouses, or three years for H-4 spouses.\n\nFor E, L, and H-4 dependent spouses, their EAD is automatically extended for up to 180 days if they filed a renewal application (Form I-765) before their current EAD expired and have an unexpired Form I-94 indicating valid derivative status. This automatic extension ends if their nonimmigrant status expires, their renewal application is approved or denied, or 180 days pass from their previous EAD's expiration. The automatic extension is evidenced by the expired EAD (with specific categories), a Notice of Action for Form I-765 showing timely filing, and an unexpired Form I-94. Reverification is needed at the end of the extension period.\n\nNote that this policy does not apply to spouses of TECRO/TECO employees, E-2 CNMI Investors, or spouses of E-2 CNMI investors with a Foreign Retiree Investment Certificate.",

Continuous residence means maintaining a permanent dwelling place.\n*   **Breaks in Residence:**\n    *   Absences of more than 6 months but less than 1 year are presumed to break continuity, but this presumption can be overcome with evidence (e.g., family remained in the U.S., maintained a U.S. home, didn't terminate U.S. employment).\n    *   Absences of 1 year or more automatically break continuity, unless an Application to Preserve Residence for Naturalization Purposes (Form N-470) is approved.\n*   **Re-establishing Eligibility:** If continuous residence is broken, applicants must establish a new period of continuous residence. The time needed to re-apply varies, often requiring 4 years and 1 day (or 4 years and 6 months to avoid presumption) after returning for a 5-year requirement.\n*   **Preserving Residence (Form N-470):** Certain individuals engaged in qualifying employment abroad (e.g., with the U.S. government, American firms, or religious organizations) can file Form N-470 to preserve their U.S. residence for naturalization purposes. Specific criteria apply, including a prior year of physical presence in the U.S.\n*   **Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI):** Residence in the CNMI is now counted towards continuous residence for naturalization purposes on or after November 28, 2009.\n*   **Documentation:** Simply possessing a Permanent Resident Card (PRC) is not enough; applicants must demonstrate actual maintenance of their principal dwelling place in the U.S. through evidence.\n*   **Updates:** The document also notes technical updates to the USCIS Policy Manual regarding terminology, clarification of absence rules, and incorporation of previous Adjudicator's Field Manual content.

The determination of GMC is made on a case-by-case basis, considering the alien's record, application statements, and interview testimony. Certain criminal conduct can automatically preclude an alien from establishing GMC. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 provided the first statutory definition of GMC, listing specific conduct that precludes it, along with a catch-all provision for other disqualifying behavior. GMC must be demonstrated during the statutory period prior to filing and up to the Oath of Allegiance, and past conduct outside this period can also be relevant. The chapter also details legal authorities, resources, and updates related to naturalization policy, including a significant update regarding the citizenship acquisition for children of U.S. military and government employees stationed abroad.

The policy emphasizes that conduct outside the statutory period can be considered if it reflects a lack of reformation.\n\nThe document provides a comprehensive definition of \"conviction\" for immigration purposes, including nuances related to withheld adjudications, juvenile convictions, court-martial convictions, deferred adjudications, vacated judgments, foreign convictions, pardons, and expunged records. It clarifies that certain outcomes, like pre-trial diversion programs without an admission of guilt, may not constitute a conviction.\n\nFurthermore, the policy addresses the effect of probation, parole, or suspended sentences, noting that satisfactory completion does not automatically preclude GMC but may still influence the determination. It also details the requirements for an applicant's admission of certain criminal acts to be considered valid for immigration purposes, including the need for the applicant to understand the law, the elements of the offense, and to voluntarily admit guilt under oath.\n\nThe document also explains the \"purely political offense\" exception, which can waive certain GMC bars for convictions abroad, and the concept of \"extenuating circumstances\" that may mitigate adverse findings for specific offenses like failure to support dependents or adultery.

They must have been married to a U.S. citizen \"regularly stationed abroad\" in qualifying employment for at least one year. Furthermore, they must demonstrate a good faith intent to reside abroad with their U.S. citizen spouse and to return to the U.S. immediately upon the termination of the qualifying employment abroad, with a plan to depart to join the citizen spouse within 30 to 45 days after naturalization.\n\nSpouses must also meet standard naturalization requirements, including basic English proficiency, knowledge of U.S. history and government, and demonstrate good moral character for at least three years prior to filing until naturalization. The definition of \"qualifying employment abroad\" includes positions within the U.S. government (including armed forces), American institutions of research, certain American firms or corporations involved in foreign trade, public international organizations, or religious/ministerial roles.\n\nThe period of \"regularly stationed abroad\" is calculated from the time the applicant spouse properly files for naturalization, and the U.S. citizen spouse's qualifying employment abroad must be scheduled to last for at least one year from the filing date.

Continuous residence and physical presence requirements are waived for this category.\n*   **Honorable Service:** This is defined by the executive department under which the service member served. Current service members need a certification of honorable service from their branch, while separated members need official discharge documentation. Discharge characterizations like \"Honorable\" and \"General (Under Honorable Conditions)\" qualify. \"Uncharacterized\" discharges may qualify if issued before August 1, 2024. Discharges for refusing COVID-19 vaccination may be eligible for upgrade.\n*   **Multiple Periods of Service:** Eligibility can be based on one qualifying period of honorable service, even if other periods of service had different discharge characterizations.\n*   **National Guard Service:** Qualifying service includes honorable service in the U.S. armed forces or the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve. Federal activation is not always required for Selected Reserve members.\n*   **Designated Periods of Hostilities:** These include World War I, World War II, the Korean Conflict, Vietnam Hostilities, the Persian Gulf Conflict, and the War on Terrorism (continuing).\n*   **Permanent Resident Status/Presence:** Applicants are generally not required to be lawful permanent residents if they were physically present in specific U.S. locations or on a U.S. public vessel at the time of enlistment/induction.\n*   **Conditional Permanent Residence:** This status does not prevent naturalization under this provision if other requirements are met.\n*   **MAVNI Program:** This former program recruited individuals with vital skills. Eligibility had specific immigration status and duration requirements. A settlement agreement (Calixto Agreement) impacts certain MAVNI applicants, potentially allowing certification of honorable service even without completing initial training.\n*   **Veterans Residing Outside the U.S.:** These individuals must appear for an interview in the U.S. and may need to seek parole.\n*   **Appendices and Updates:** Detail historical legislative changes, policy clarifications regarding uncharacterized discharges, MAVNI program updates, and changes to residency requirements for children of military members.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources, appendices, and updates related to the policy.",

A three-part test assesses opposition to military service, the grounding of this opposition in belief systems, and the sincerity of these beliefs. Belonging to a specific religion is not required, but the belief must be sincere and meaningful. Evidence can include oral testimony, written statements, or witness statements. If insufficient evidence is provided initially, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence.\n\n2.  **Affirmation of Allegiance in Lieu of Oath:** Applicants can request to substitute \"solemnly affirm\" for \"on oath\" and omit \"so help me God\" for any reason. This modification is granted solely upon request, without requiring justification based on religious beliefs or supporting evidence.\n\n3.  **Waiver of the Oath:**\n    *   **Disability Waiver:** The oath can be waived if an applicant is unable to understand or communicate the meaning of the oath due to a physical, developmental, or mental impairment.

The applicant has 15 days to respond. USCIS will not administer the Oath if disqualifying information is received until it's resolved.

It clarifies that revocation of naturalization, also known as denaturalization, can only occur in federal court, either through civil proceedings or following a criminal conviction. The government bears a high burden of proof for revocation: clear, convincing, and unequivocal evidence for civil cases, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal cases. USCIS refers cases for civil revocation when there's sufficient evidence of illegal procurement or concealment of material facts/willful misrepresentation. A separate ground for revocation exists for those naturalized under military provisions who are discharged under other than honorable conditions before five years of honorable service.\n\nThe background section emphasizes that USCIS lacks statutory authority for administrative revocation, as established by a 2001 injunction. All related documentation is subject to discovery during judicial revocation proceedings.\n\nA key distinction is made between revocation and cancellation of a Certificate of Citizenship or Naturalization. USCIS can cancel a certificate if it was illegally or fraudulently obtained, but this cancellation only affects the document, not the person's underlying citizenship status. Revocation, however, requires a judicial process and affects the person's status as a citizen. Revocation is appropriate when a person has completed the naturalization process (N-400 application, interview, approval, and Oath of Allegiance). Conversely, if someone obtained a certificate without going through the USCIS process, USCIS can cancel the certificate as the individual never acquired citizenship status.\n\nThe chapter also lists the legal authorities for revocation (INA 340, 8 CFR 340) and administrative cancellation (INA 342, 8 CFR 342).

This applies even without willful deception.\n*   **Concealment of Material Fact or Willful Misrepresentation:** This applies if the individual deliberately misrepresented or concealed a material fact on their application or during the examination. The misrepresentation or concealment must be willful, material (meaning it tended to affect the decision), and the individual must have procured citizenship as a result. This includes omissions and can involve oral testimony or written application information.\n*   **Membership or Affiliation with Certain Organizations:** Naturalization can be revoked if the individual joins the Communist Party, another totalitarian party, or a terrorist organization within five years of naturalization. This is considered prima facie evidence of concealment or misrepresentation that would have prevented naturalization.\n*   **Other than Honorable Discharge after Military Service:** If a person naturalized based on honorable military service and is subsequently discharged under other than honorable conditions before completing at least five years of honorable service, their naturalization can be revoked.",

These requests are generally filed using Form I-129 or I-539. USCIS exercises discretion in approving or denying these requests, considering various factors.\n*   **Timely Filing:** Generally, USCIS does not approve late requests unless extraordinary circumstances beyond the applicant's control caused the delay, the delay is commensurate with the circumstances, the applicant has maintained status, remains a bona fide nonimmigrant, and is not in removal or deportation proceedings.\n*   **Extension of Petition Validity:** This often accompanies an EOS request and relies on prior eligibility findings. However, the petitioner still bears the burden of proof. USCIS is not strictly bound by prior approvals if there were material errors, changes in circumstances, or new adverse information. Any deviation from a prior approval must be justified and explained, and the applicant must be given an opportunity to respond.\n*   **Deference to Other Agencies:** USCIS considers, but does not defer to, eligibility determinations made by CBP or DOS.\n*   **Split Decisions:** USCIS may approve a petition for a continued nonimmigrant classification while denying the EOS request if sufficient grounds for denial exist, even if eligibility for the classification is maintained.\n*   **Updates:** The manual has seen several updates, including changes to terminology (e.g., \"alien\" vs. \"noncitizen\"), clarifications on excusing untimely filings, guidance on deference to prior determinations, and adjustments related to the public charge rule and fee schedule.",

F-1 students are limited to 12 months and must reimburse the school for educational costs. M-1 students have a maximum attendance of one year, including study, practical training, and departure time.\n\n**Online and Distance Education:** For F-1 students, only one online or distance education class (or three credits) can count towards a full course of study per academic session, unless it's a language study program or the final course. M-1 students cannot count online or distance education classes unless physical attendance is integral to completion.\n\n**Other Programs:** F-1 or M-1 students cannot enroll in adult education programs funded by federal, state, or local governments. F-1 students pursuing English language training must enroll in accredited programs, and online/distance courses do not count towards their full course of study. M-1 students can only take English training if it's for vocational/technical understanding.\n\n**Concurrent Enrollment:** F-1 students can enroll in two SEVP-certified schools if the combined enrollment constitutes a full course of study, with the primary school issuing the I-20. M-1 students cannot concurrently enroll in two schools.\n\n**Full Course of Study:** Requirements vary for F-1 and M-1 students. F-1 requirements include postgraduate study, seminary study, undergraduate study (at least 12 credit hours), specific postsecondary non-vocational programs (18-22 clock hours), or academic high school curriculum. M-1 requirements include community college studies (at least 12 credit hours), postsecondary vocational/business programs (at least 12 hours), vocational/nonacademic curriculum (18-22 hours), or vocational high school curriculum. Border commuter students may have a reduced course load authorized by a DSO.\n\n**Reduced Course Load:** F-1 students need DSO authorization for a reduced course load, which can be granted for initial academic difficulties (once per program level), temporary illness/medical conditions, or to complete their program in the final term. Students must maintain at least 6 credit hours or half the required clock hours. M-1 students require DSO authorization for reduced course loads solely for documented illness or medical conditions, with a total aggregate limit of 5 months per course of study.

One year or more of full-time CPT makes a student ineligible for post-completion OPT at the same educational level.\n*   **Optional Practical Training (OPT):** This can be pre-completion (while studying) or post-completion (after completing studies). Pre-completion OPT is limited to 20 hours per week while school is in session. A student is generally eligible for 12 months of OPT, which can be extended for STEM fields. Significant CPT usage can reduce OPT eligibility. OPT terminates if the student transfers schools, begins a new degree level, changes status, fails to maintain F-1 status, or the school closes.\n*   **STEM OPT Extension:** Eligible students with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics can apply for a 24-month extension of their post-completion OPT. This requires an employer's commitment to a formal training program, adherence to reporting requirements, and specific employer eligibility.\n\n**For M-1 Students:**\n*   **Practical Training (PT):** This is the only work authorization available to M-1 students and can only be pursued after completing their course of study. It allows for on-the-job training not available in their home country and is granted for a duration based on study completed, up to a maximum of six months.\n\n**F-1 \"Cap-gap\" Extension:**\n*   This provides an automatic extension of F-1 status and employment authorization for students who have an H-1B petition filed on their behalf, ensuring continuity between the end of their OPT and the start of their H-1B employment on October 1st.\n\n**Key requirements for all practical training generally include:**\n*   Acceptance at an SEVP-certified school.\n*   Maintaining full-time study (unless a reduced course load is authorized).\n*   Obtaining recommendations and endorsements from the Designated School Official (DSO).\n*   Receiving approval and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS.\n*   Students in English language training programs are ineligible for PT.",

On-campus employment is permitted for up to 20 hours per week during the academic year, and full-time during vacations, with Designated School Official (DSO) approval. Off-campus employment for F-1 students requires at least one full academic year in F-1 status, good academic standing, and USCIS authorization.\n\nSevere economic hardship is a key reason for off-campus employment authorization, covering situations like loss of financial aid, currency fluctuations, or unexpected expenses. Students must be recommended by their DSO and obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) from USCIS. Special Student Relief (SSR) is also available for F-1 students facing severe economic hardship due to emergent circumstances, which may allow for suspension of certain regulatory requirements, including reduced course loads and extended employment authorization, as designated by DHS.\n\nM-1 students are generally limited to employment for practical training purposes. Documentation requirements vary, with F-1 students often needing DSO endorsement on their Form I-20 for on-campus employment and USCIS authorization (Form I-765 and EAD) for off-campus employment.

Students can only begin F-1 activities 30 days before their program start date. If approved more than 30 days prior, students must maintain lawful status during the interim period, avoiding unauthorized employment.\n*   **Deferred Program Start Dates:** If an F-1 change of status is not approved before the program start date, the Designated School Official (DSO) must defer the date in SEVIS.\n*   **Previous USCIS Policy:** USCIS previously required continuous nonimmigrant status up to 30 days before the program start date, often necessitating multiple applications. This has been streamlined.\n*   **Nonimmigrants Unable to Enroll:** Visitors (B-1/B-2) must apply for a change of status to F-1 before they can enroll in a full course of study.\n*   **Travel Abroad:** Traveling abroad while a change of status application is pending is considered an abandonment of the application. Re-entry after F-1 COS approval is restricted to 30 days before the program start date.\n*   **Extension of Stay (F-1):** F-1 students admitted for \"duration of status\" do not need to apply for an extension as long as they maintain status and progress academically. Program extensions require DSO certification for compelling academic or medical reasons.\n*   **Reinstatement to F-1 Status:** Students out of status may be reinstated if they meet specific criteria, including timely application, no repeated violations, intent to study, and a favorable discretionary decision. Violations must be due to circumstances beyond their control or manageable course load reductions leading to extreme hardship.\n*   **M-1 Students:** M-1 students have a cumulative limit of 3 years for extensions, including practical training. Extensions require maintaining status, compelling educational/medical reasons, and intent to continue status. Applications must be filed with USCIS between 15 and 60 days before the program end date.\n*   **Length of Stay (F-1 & M-1):** F-1 students can be admitted up to 30 days before the program start date and are generally admitted for duration of status.

If withdrawing with DSO approval, they have 15 days. M-1 students have a 30-day grace period after completing studies/training. Failure to maintain status negates these grace periods.\n*   **Table Comparison:** A table compares F-1 and M-1 requirements for school certification, student bona fides, funding, study load, public schools, transfers, practical training, maximum stay, program extensions, and family members.\n*   **Updates:** The document also lists recent updates to the USCIS Policy Manual concerning discretionary analysis, nonimmigrant students, and technical changes to terminology.",

      "summary": "Chapter 10 of the USCIS Policy Manual details the duration and extensions of T nonimmigrant status.\n\n**Duration of Status:**\n*   Principal T nonimmigrants are initially granted 4 years of status, which can be extended.\n*   Derivative family members receive status for a period not exceeding the principal's approved duration.\n*   T nonimmigrant status is automatically extended by operation of law while an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) is pending.\n\n**Extensions of Status:**\nUSCIS may grant discretionary extensions of T nonimmigrant status for up to 4 additional years in two main circumstances:\n1.  **Law Enforcement Need:** A law enforcement agency certifies that the nonimmigrant's presence is necessary for an investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.\n2.  **Exceptional Circumstances:** USCIS determines an extension is warranted due to exceptional circumstances.\n\n**Applying for Extensions:**\n*   **Based on Adjustment of Status (Form I-485):** If filed while the T nonimmigrant status is valid, a separate Form I-539 is not required. The receipt notice for the Form I-485 indicates an automatic extension while the application is pending. T nonimmigrants are authorized to work while their adjustment application is pending, with specific evidence requirements for employment authorization. Derivative T nonimmigrants must independently file an adjustment application and Form I-765 for employment authorization.\n*   **Based on Law Enforcement Need or Exceptional Circumstances:** The T nonimmigrant must file Form I-539 with supporting evidence. The applicant bears the burden of proof for this discretionary extension. Derivative family members not previously in T status must independently apply. Approved extensions are typically for 1 year and require filing an application for employment authorization.\n\n**Timing of Applications:**\n*   Form I-539 should generally be filed before the current T nonimmigrant status expires, though USCIS has discretion to grant late filings with justification.\n*   Denials of Form I-539 are not appealable, but a motion to reopen or reconsider can be filed.\n\n**Evidence for Extensions:**\n*   **Law Enforcement Need:** Requires a newly executed Form I-914, Supplement B, or other evidence directly from a law enforcement agency involved in the case.\n*   **Exceptional Circumstances:** May include medical records, police reports, news articles, correspondence, evidence of consular processing delays, or affidavits. The applicant must demonstrate how these circumstances necessitate the extension. Merely needing to accrue physical presence for adjustment of status is generally not considered an exceptional circumstance, though USCIS may consider delays outside the applicant's control (e.g., COVID-19, consular delays for derivatives).\n\n**Considerations for Family Members:**\n*   Derivative T nonimmigrants must maintain T status to apply for adjustment of status.\n*   Their status is automatically extended upon filing for adjustment of status.\n*   If a principal T nonimmigrant's status expires or they adjust status, derivative family members are no longer eligible for initial admission as T visa holders. It is recommended for principals to extend their status based on exceptional circumstances if derivatives are awaiting admission.",

If revocation occurs, USCIS may notify the LEA, consular officer, or the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The applicant has 30 days to appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Office.\n\n**Effect of Revocation:**\n*   **Principal's Application:** Revocation of a T-1 principal's status terminates the status for the principal and all derivatives. Pending derivative applications will be denied, and any related waivers of inadmissibility are also revoked. This does not affect the annual cap.\n*   **Derivative Status (T-2 to T-5):** Revocation of derivative status may affect the eligibility of T-6 derivatives. If the revocation is due to the derivative beneficiary's own eligibility issues, their child may not qualify for T-6 status. However, if the revocation is unrelated to the derivative's eligibility (e.g., divorce for a T-2 spouse), the child may still be eligible for T-6 status.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the eligibility requirements for T nonimmigrant status, which is available to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons. To qualify, principal applicants must demonstrate they have been victims of severe trafficking, are physically present in the U.S. on account of that trafficking, have complied with reasonable requests for assistance from law enforcement (unless exempted due to age or trauma), would suffer extreme hardship if removed, and are admissible to the U.S. or qualify for a waiver.\n\nThe document defines \"severe form of trafficking\" to include both sex and labor trafficking, detailing the elements of action, purpose, and means for each. It elaborates on key terms like \"harboring,\" \"coercion\" (including threats of serious harm, physical restraint, abuse of legal process, and schemes/patterns), \"involuntary servitude,\" \"peonage,\" \"debt bondage,\" and \"slavery.\" It also clarifies that actual performance of labor or sex acts, or receiving compensation, is not always required to establish victim status, and that labor or services can include non-traditional work.\n\nThe physical presence requirement is met if the applicant is currently being subjected to trafficking, was liberated by law enforcement, escaped before law enforcement involvement, their continued presence is directly related to past trafficking, or they were allowed entry to participate in investigative/judicial processes. Departures from the U.S. generally break physical presence unless reentry is due to continued victimization, a new incident of trafficking, or participation in investigative/judicial processes.\n\nCompliance with reasonable law enforcement requests is generally required, but exemptions exist for victims under 18 or those who cannot cooperate due to trauma. The reasonableness of a request is assessed based on the totality of circumstances, using a \"comparably-situated crime victim\" standard. Contact with a law enforcement agency with jurisdiction is usually necessary, unless an exemption applies.\n\nExtreme hardship upon removal must involve unusual and severe harm, not just economic detriment. Factors considered include the applicant's age, family ties, length of U.S. residence, health, community ties, immigration history, and specific impacts of trafficking, such as psychological trauma, risk of re-victimization, and lack of protection in the home country.\n\nFinally, applicants must be admissible or qualify for a waiver. Those who have committed severe trafficking are barred, and lawful permanent residents, conditional permanent residents, and U.S. citizens are ineligible for T nonimmigrant status.

      "summary": "The Bona Fide Determination (BFD) process, implemented by USCIS, allows for granting deferred action and Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) to individuals with pending, bona fide applications for T nonimmigrant status. This process aims to promote victim stability and cooperation with law enforcement. The BFD process involves two steps: first, determining if the application is complete and passes initial background checks without national security concerns; second, exercising discretion to grant deferred action and an EAD, considering all relevant factors. Deferred action and BFD EADs are only available to individuals residing in the United States.\n\nAn application is considered \"bona fide\" if it is made in good faith, without fraud or deceit. For principal applicants, this means a complete Form I-914 was filed and background checks show no national security concerns. For eligible family members, their application (Form I-914, Supplement A) must also be bona fide, requiring the principal's application to be bona fide, the derivative's application to be complete, credible evidence of their eligibility as a family member, and successful background checks.\n\nUSCIS exercises discretion in granting deferred action and BFD EADs, considering public safety and national security. This involves reviewing background and security checks, including biometrics. Adverse factors, such as convictions or arrests for serious crimes (including murder, rape, sexual abuse, offenses involving firearms, slavery, aggravated assault, child pornography, and drug offenses), may lead USCIS to deny deferred action and proceed to a full adjudication (secondary review). However, USCIS may still exercise discretion favorably based on the totality of circumstances.\n\nIf an application is deemed bona fide and warrants a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS may grant deferred action and issue a BFD EAD. A bona fide determination also establishes a prima facie case for an administrative stay of removal. It's important to note that an initial grant of deferred action and a BFD EAD does not guarantee final approval for T nonimmigrant status.\n\nA decision not to grant deferred action and a BFD EAD is not a denial of the underlying Form I-914. Such decisions lead to a secondary review, which is a full adjudication of T nonimmigrant status eligibility. USCIS uses a pending Form I-765 to issue a BFD EAD. Applicants who have filed both forms receive an EAD valid for 4 years from approval. Those who haven't filed Form I-765 will receive a notice and must file it separately to obtain an EAD.\n\nRenewals of deferred action and BFD EADs are discretionary and require ongoing review of the applicant's continued eligibility and favorable exercise of discretion. Background and security checks are updated regularly, and USCIS may terminate or revoke deferred action and BFD EADs if they are no longer warranted or were granted in error, particularly if adverse information arises regarding national security, public safety, or other discretionary factors.",

Principal petitioners can also petition for qualifying family members. The U visa is typically granted for up to 4 years, with employment authorization automatically provided to principal petitioners and qualifying family members in the U.S. After three years of continuous physical presence in the U.S. on U nonimmigrant status, individuals may apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.\n\nSeveral legislative acts have amended U visa provisions, including those related to duration of status, eligibility for individuals on other visa types, stays of removal, and age-out protection for family members.\n\nThe U visa program has a statutory cap of 10,000 visas per fiscal year for principal petitioners, which has been met annually since FY 2010. Due to a high volume of petitions and lengthy processing times, USCIS implemented a Bona Fide Determination (BFD) process in June 2021. This process allows USCIS to grant employment authorization and deferred action to principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending, bona fide petitions who merit a favorable exercise of discretion, distinct from the traditional waiting list process. This policy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities faced by victims due to long adjudication periods and improve efficiency.\n\nLegal authorities underpinning the U visa program include various sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), detailing definitions, requirements, waivers, and penalties.\n\nThe BFD process involves reviewing the completeness of the petition and biometrics, along with background and security checks. Employment authorization and deferred action under BFD are generally valid for 4 years. The implementation of this policy applies to all pending and new Form I-918 petitions filed on or after June 14, 2021.

Importantly, qualifying family members do not need to meet the eligibility criteria of demonstrating helpfulness or suffering substantial abuse.\n\n**Bona Fide Determination (BFD) Process:**\nDue to a significant backlog of U visa petitions, USCIS implemented a policy on June 14, 2021, to provide employment authorization and deferred action to principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending, bona fide petitions. This process allows for earlier access to benefits for those in the U.S. A petition is considered \"bona fide\" if it is complete, properly filed, and biometrics have been received, along with a law enforcement certification. USCIS also conducts security checks to ensure the petitioner does not pose a national security or public safety risk. This BFD process aims to mitigate vulnerabilities for victims of crime during lengthy adjudication periods.\n\n**Implementation:**\nThe policy began on June 14, 2021, and applies to all Form I-918 petitions pending on or filed after that date. The guidance in the Policy Manual supersedes prior guidance. The process involves reviewing updated background and security checks at regular intervals for those granted BFD EADs and deferred action. The adjudication of petitions, whether through the BFD process or the waiting list, will be based on the date the petition was filed to ensure equitable treatment.",

These petitioners also receive interim benefits of employment authorization and deferred action for 4 years, with parole possible for those outside the U.S.\n\n**Final Adjudication** makes the definitive eligibility determination and grants U nonimmigrant status and employment authorization for up to 4 years to those whose petitions are approved and have a visa available.\n\nThe BFD process was implemented on June 14, 2021, to address increased petition volume and backlogs, allowing USCIS to exercise discretion in granting interim benefits to petitioners with pending, bona fide applications, thereby mitigating vulnerabilities faced by victims of crime during long adjudication periods. This process is considered an interpretive rule and general statement of policy, not requiring notice and comment. Criminal history checks are performed at regular intervals for BFD EADs and deferred action to ensure continued eligibility.

This process, implemented under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008, aims to expedite benefits for eligible petitioners and enhance victim stability and cooperation with law enforcement.\n\nTo be considered \"bona fide,\" a principal petitioner's Form I-918 must be complete, with all required initial evidence and successful completion of background checks, excluding the Form I-192 at this stage. For qualifying family members, their petition must also be bona fide, including evidence of the relationship and successful background checks, contingent on the principal petitioner receiving a BFD.\n\nAfter a petition is deemed bona fide, USCIS exercises discretion to determine if the petitioner poses a risk to national security or public safety. This involves reviewing background checks and other relevant factors. Petitioners identified as a risk generally do not receive a BFD EAD and proceed to a waiting list adjudication.\n\nUSCIS generally issues BFD EADs and deferred action for a period of 4 years. These benefits can be renewed but are subject to ongoing review and potential revocation if adverse information arises or if the initial grant is deemed unwarranted. Petitioners residing outside the U.S. are not eligible for BFD EADs or deferred action and proceed directly to waiting list adjudication. The BFD process establishes a prima facie case for approval, and petitioners not issued a BFD EAD are evaluated for waiting list eligibility.

      "summary": "This chapter of the USCIS Policy Manual details the \"Waiting List\" process for U nonimmigrant status petitioners. When the annual cap of 10,000 visas is reached, eligible remaining petitioners are placed on a waiting list.\n\n**Key aspects of the waiting list process include:**\n\n*   **Eligibility for Benefits:** Principal petitioners on the waiting list are eligible for employment authorization and deferred action, or parole in limited cases. These benefits are also extended to their qualifying family members.\n*   **Adjudication Process:** While a Bona Fide Determination (BFD) process initiates some benefits, a full eligibility adjudication for U nonimmigrant status occurs during the waiting list process. Officers can issue Requests for Evidence (RFEs) or Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs) during this stage.\n*   **Expedited Processing:** U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can request expedited waiting list adjudications for specific enforcement priorities.\n*   **Eligibility Requirements:** To be placed on the waiting list, petitioners must meet all statutory and regulatory requirements by a preponderance of the evidence. They are considered eligible but not yet granted U nonimmigrant status due to the cap.\n*   **Full Evaluation:** USCIS conducts a case-by-case evaluation, including determining victim status of qualifying criminal activity, assessing substantial mental and physical abuse, reviewing the U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Form I-918, Supplement B), completing background checks, and assessing waivable inadmissibility grounds.\n*   **Inadmissibility:** Petitioners inadmissible under INA 212(a) are generally ineligible, though USCIS may exercise discretion to waive grounds of inadmissibility, except in cases of national security risk, serious immigration violations, or fraud.\n*   **Final Adjudication:** Even after initial waiting list approval, USCIS re-reviews petitions for final eligibility when visa numbers become available.\n*   **Benefits Upon Waiting List Placement:** USCIS issues a notice confirming eligibility for work authorization and deferred action. Employment authorization is granted under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14). Waitlisted petitioners do not accrue unlawful presence.\n*   **Duration of Benefits:** Employment authorization is typically granted for 4 years and can be renewed if the individual remains on the waiting list.\n*   **Bona Fide Determination (BFD) Process:** Since June 14, 2021, USCIS has exercised its discretion to conduct BFDs for pending, bona fide petitions, granting employment authorization and deferred action to petitioners in the U.S. This process aims to provide benefits more quickly due to significant backlogs and lengthy wait times.\n*   **BFD Criteria:** A petition is considered \"bona fide\" if it's complete, properly filed, and biometrics have been received. USCIS also assesses national security and public safety risks.\n*   **APA Considerations:** The BFD process is implemented through Policy Manual guidance, considered an interpretive rule, and does not require notice and comment rulemaking. USCIS aims to provide benefits without unfair surprise or undue burden.\n*   **Criminal History Checks:** USCIS continuously evaluates background and security checks for BFD EAD recipients and deferred action grantees, with the ability to update these checks at any time.\n*   **Implementation:** This policy applies to all Form I-918 petitions pending or filed on or after June 14, 2021.\n\nThe chapter also includes extensive footnotes referencing relevant regulations, statutes, and legal precedents, as well as lists of resources and appendices.",

Evidence of this status is required.\n*   **Good Faith Marriage (for spouses):** Spouses must demonstrate that the marriage was entered into in good faith, not solely for immigration purposes.\n*   **Eligibility for Immigrant Classification:** The self-petitioner must be eligible for immediate relative or family-based preference category classification.\n*   **Battery or Extreme Cruelty:** Proof that the self-petitioner (or their child, in the case of a spouse) was subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by the U.S. citizen or LPR relative. Definitions and examples of both are provided.\n*   **Residence with Abuser:** The self-petitioner must have resided with the abuser at some point prior to filing, though this does not need to be during the qualifying relationship or in the U.S. (with exceptions for children).\n*   **Good Moral Character:** Self-petitioners must generally demonstrate good moral character, with specific considerations for children under 14 and provisions for permanent and conditional bars.\n\n**Evidence requirements vary by relationship type:**\n\n*   **Spouses:** Need to prove the legal validity of the marriage, good faith, and termination of prior marriages, if applicable. \"Intended spouses\" may be eligible in cases of bigamy/polygamy by the abuser. Spouses can also self-petition based on abuse against their child.\n*   **Children:** Must establish a biological, step, or adopted relationship with the abusive parent and meet age requirements (under 21 and unmarried, with some exceptions). Specific evidence is required for biological children born in or out of wedlock, legitimated children, stepchildren, and adopted children.\n*   **Parents:** Must prove a biological, step, or adoptive relationship with an abusive U.S. citizen son or daughter who is 21 or older.

      "summary": "Chapter 3 of the USCIS Policy Manual, \"Effect of Certain Life Events,\" details how various life events can impact the eligibility and adjudication of VAWA self-petitions. Key events discussed include divorce, remarriage, the death of a qualifying relative or self-petitioner, loss of citizenship or LPR status by the abuser, and a child turning 21.\n\n**Divorce:**\n*   **Self-petitioning spouse:** Can still be eligible if the divorce occurred before filing, provided the petition is filed within two years of the divorce and the divorce was linked to the abuser's battery or extreme cruelty. This two-year deadline is strict.\n*   **Step-relationship termination:** Divorce of the parents does not affect a stepchild or stepparent's eligibility if the step-relationship existed legally at the time of abuse and the stepchild was under 18 when the marriage creating the step-relationship occurred.\n*   **Death of a parent:** A stepchild or stepparent can remain eligible if the step-relationship existed legally at the time of abuse, the stepchild was under 18 when the creating marriage occurred, and there was evidence of an ongoing family relationship at the time of filing.\n\n**Marriage/Remarriage:**\n*   **Self-petitioning child:** Must be unmarried at the time of filing and approval. Marriage after filing but before a final decision may be acceptable if the marriage terminates before the decision.\n*   **Self-petitioning spouse:** Remarriage after approval has no impact. Remarriage before approval will lead to denial.\n\n**Marriage-Related Prohibitions:**\n*   **Marriage during removal proceedings:** A self-petition filed while the applicant is in removal proceedings is generally prohibited, but can be overcome by demonstrating either residence abroad for two years after marriage or providing clear and convincing evidence that the marriage was in good faith, not to circumvent immigration laws, and no fee was paid for the marriage itself. The standard of proof for good faith in this exemption is higher (clear and convincing) than the usual preponderance of the evidence.\n*   **Prior marriage fraud:** If USCIS finds substantial and probative evidence of prior marriage fraud or attempts to evade immigration laws through marriage, the self-petition cannot be approved unless the self-petitioner overcomes this finding.\n\n**Death:**\n*   **Abusive U.S. Citizen Dies:**\n    *   **Before filing:** Spouses/parents can file within 2 years of death (strict deadline). Children are ineligible if the abusive citizen parent dies before they file.\n    *   **During pendency or after approval:** Death of the U.S. citizen does not impact eligibility for a pending or approved petition.\n*   **Abusive Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) Dies:**\n    *   **Before filing:** Spouses/children are ineligible.\n    *   **During pendency or after approval:** USCIS may approve the petition or adjustment of status application (discretionary) if the self-petitioner or derivatives resided in the U.S. at the time of the LPR's death and continue to reside in the U.S. at the time of approval.\n*   **Self-Petitioner Dies:** USCIS may approve the petition for derivative children (discretionary) under INA 204(l).\n\n**Loss of Status:**\n*   **Abuser's Status Loss Before Filing:** Self-petitioners may remain eligible if the abuser's loss/renunciation of citizenship/LPR status was related to domestic violence and occurred within 2 years prior to filing (strict deadline). Parents must have had an abusive son/daughter aged 21+ at the time of status loss.\n*   **Abuser's Status Loss After Filing:** For spouses and children, this loss does not impact eligibility or approved petitions. For parents, it can lead to ineligibility or revocation of an approved petition if the U.S. citizen son/daughter denaturalizes or loses/renounces status.\n\n**Naturalization of LPR:**\n*   If an abusive LPR naturalizes after a spouse or child files a self-petition, the self-petitioner is automatically reclassified as the spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, even if divorced or parental rights terminated.\n\n**Child Turning 21:**\n*   **Before Filing:** Children may still file if they were eligible the day before turning 21, remain unmarried, and abuse was a central reason for the filing delay (e.g., abuse occurred close to age 21, or trauma prevented timely filing). The filing is treated as if made before turning 21, with eligibility governed by CSPA or VTVPA.\n*   **After Filing:** Under CSPA or VTVPA, children (self-petitioners or derivatives) generally retain eligibility as \"children\" if they remain unmarried, even if they turn 21 after the petition is filed.

It details the initial review process by USCIS, emphasizing that the form must be the current edition, filed at the correct location, and properly signed to be considered properly filed. Improperly filed petitions are rejected, while properly filed ones receive a receipt notice with a filing date. There is no fee for filing Form I-360 as a VAWA self-petition.\n\nThe document also explains the process for adjusting status, noting that spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens can adjust status immediately as immediate relatives. For spouses or children of lawful permanent residents (LPRs) seeking to adjust under a family-based preference category, waiting for visa availability might be necessary. If a visa is available, the Form I-485 can be filed concurrently with, during, or after the I-360 filing.\n\nA key concept discussed is the \"priority date,\" which is generally the filing date of the self-petition and is used to determine visa availability via the Department of State's Visa Bulletin. Self-petitioners may retain a priority date from a previously filed Form I-130 by the abusive relative, under certain conditions, especially for derivative beneficiaries who must be under 21 and unmarried at the time of the I-360 filing.\n\nFurthermore, the document details the documentation requirements for self-petitioners, who must provide evidence to establish eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. This includes proof of the abuser's U.S. citizenship or LPR status, evidence of the qualifying relationship, proof of entering the marriage in good faith (for spouses), evidence of battery or extreme cruelty, proof of shared residence with the abuser, and evidence of good moral character for those 14 or older. USCIS will consider any credible evidence, with the weight given to it at their discretion.\n\nFinally, the document lists relevant resources, including specific CFR and INA sections, forms, and USCIS Policy Manual volumes, and notes recent updates regarding terminology changes and the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

A positive prima facie determination can qualify self-petitioners for certain public benefits. This review does not apply to self-petitions filed from outside the U.S.\n*   **Establishing a Prima Facie Case:** This requires submitting a completed Form I-360 and evidence addressing eligibility requirements, though not necessarily proving them at this stage. A Notice of Prima Facie Case (NPFC) is issued if successful.\n*   **NPFC Validity and Renewals:** The NPFC is initially valid for one year and can be renewed in 180-day increments until the self-petition is adjudicated. It does not confer immigration status.\n*   **Standard of Proof:** The primary standard for proving eligibility is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" meaning it's more likely than not that the self-petitioner qualifies.\n*   **\"Any Credible Evidence\" Provision:** For VAWA self-petitioners, USCIS must consider any credible evidence submitted, recognizing potential difficulties in obtaining primary documents due to abuse. The weight and credibility of evidence are at USCIS's discretion.\n*   **Decision-Making:** Approving or denying a self-petition is not discretionary; it's based on whether eligibility requirements are met by a preponderance of the evidence.\n    *   **Approvals:** Lead to immediate relative status for spouses, children, and parents of abusive U.S. citizens, allowing for immediate adjustment of status. Spouses and children of abusive LPRs follow preference categories for visa availability. Approved petitions enable applications for lawful permanent resident status and employment authorization.\n    *   **Denials:** Occur when eligibility is not demonstrated. Self-petitioners are notified in writing with reasons and the right to appeal. A denial doesn't prevent refiling.\n*   **Special Considerations:** When a self-petition is filed after a family-based petition and adjustment application, USCIS can hold adjudication of the adjustment application to await self-petition adjudication, changing the basis. Confidentiality protections apply if intent to self-petition is communicated.\n*   **Resources:** The document lists relevant regulations, statutes, and USCIS forms.\n*   **Updates:** Recent updates include terminology changes (e.g., \"noncitizen\" to \"alien\") and the ongoing incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

Field offices must forward requests for review to the appropriate service center.\n*   Field office officers adjudicating Form I-485 can't re-adjudicate the self-petition's merits unless they find new information suggesting revocation is warranted. This new information must be documented and cannot be information already available at the time of approval.\n*   Confidentiality provisions under 8 U.S.C. 1367 must be respected, prohibiting adverse determinations based solely on information from an abuser or their associates, and preventing unauthorized disclosure of protected information.\n*   Supervisors in field offices and service centers must review recommendations for revocation, with service centers issuing the final notice of intent to revoke. Reviews are expected to be expedited.\n\n**Appeals, Motions to Reopen, and Motions to Reconsider:**\n*   If a VAWA self-petition (Form I-360) is denied, self-petitioners can file an appeal, motion to reopen, or motion to reconsider using Form I-290B.\n*   These filings must generally be made within 30 days of denial (or 33 days if by mail).\n*   There are no exceptions to the filing period for appeals and motions to reconsider.

      "summary": "This document, Chapter 1 of the USCIS Policy Manual (Volume 3, Part F), outlines the purpose and background of the parole authority granted to the Secretary of Homeland Security under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This discretionary authority allows for the temporary parole of aliens into the U.S. for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, regardless of their admissibility. USCIS makes these case-by-case determinations and can impose conditions on parole. While parole is not an admission to the U.S., it allows temporary stay. Parole terminates automatically upon expiration, departure, or when USCIS deems the purpose fulfilled or no longer warranted. Generally, parole does not automatically grant employment authorization; a separate application and approval are required, though exceptions exist for certain groups like Afghan and Ukrainian parolees.

While parole does not constitute admission for immigration law purposes, it permits entry, stay, and work authorization.\n\nThe IEP regulations were finalized on January 17, 2017, with an effective date of July 17, 2017.

To be eligible, applicants must file Form I-941 and demonstrate that granting them parole will offer a significant public benefit to the U.S. due to their entrepreneurial role in a U.S. start-up entity with high growth and job creation potential. Applicants can be inside or outside the U.S. when applying, but those within the U.S. must depart and seek parole at a port of entry if approved.\n\n**Applicant Requirements:**\n*   **Central and Active Role:** The applicant must play a key role in the start-up's operations and be well-positioned to contribute to its success based on their knowledge, skills, or experience.\n*   **Substantial Ownership Interest:** Applicants must hold at least a 10% ownership interest at the time of adjudication. This can decrease to 5% during the initial parole period. A maximum of three entrepreneurs can be granted parole for the same start-up.\n\n**Start-up Entity Requirements:**\n*   Must be a U.S. entity (corporation, LLC, partnership, etc.) organized under federal or state law and actively conducting business.\n*   Cannot be primarily involved in securities trading.\n*   Must have been formed within the last 5 years and be lawfully operating.\n*   Must demonstrate substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\n\n**Qualified Investment or Government Award/Grant:**\nApplicants can prove the start-up's potential through:\n*   **Qualified Investment:** Investments totaling at least a specified amount (which adjusts every 3 years based on CPI) made by qualified investors within 18 months of filing. The required investment amounts are $250,000 (before Oct 1, 2021), $264,147 (Oct 1, 2021 - Sep 30, 2024), and $311,071 (on or after Oct 1, 2024). A qualified investment is a good-faith purchase of equity or convertible debt from the start-up, not from the entrepreneur or their close relations/entities.\n    *   **Qualified Investor:** A U.S. citizen, LPR, or U.S. organization that regularly makes substantial investments in start-ups showing significant growth. They must demonstrate prior investments totaling at least $600,000 (before Oct 1, 2021), $633,952 (Oct 1, 2021 - Sep 30, 2024), or $746,571 (on or after Oct 1, 2024), with at least two previous entities creating five qualified jobs or generating significant revenue with growth. Certain individuals or organizations involved in securities violations are excluded.\n*   **Government Award or Grant:** One or more qualified government awards or grants totaling at least a specified amount (which also adjusts) received within 18 months of filing. Minimum amounts are $100,000 (before Oct 1, 2021), $105,659 (Oct 1, 2021 - Sep 30, 2024), and $124,429 (on or after Oct 1, 2024). These must be for economic development, R&D, or job creation from a U.S. government entity; contractual commitments do not qualify.\n*   **Alternative Option:** If an applicant partially meets the investment or award criteria, USCIS may still consider parole if compelling additional evidence of the start-up's growth potential is provided.\n\n**Significant Public Benefit:**\nThere is no strict definition for \"significant public benefit.\" Parole decisions are discretionary and made on a case-by-case basis, considering all circumstances.",

The specific steps vary depending on whether the beneficiary is interviewed by USCIS domestically or by the Department of State (DOS) abroad. USCIS handles the initial receipt and eligibility review, which includes checking the petitioner's eligibility, timeliness, relationship to the beneficiary, and security checks. If the beneficiary is in the U.S., USCIS interviews and adjudicates the petition domestically. If abroad, USCIS forwards the petition to the National Visa Center (NVC) for processing by a USCIS international field office or a DOS embassy/consulate. USCIS interviews are generally not required for petitioners, but beneficiaries are interviewed to verify identity, relationship, and eligibility. DOS interviews focus on travel eligibility. The final USCIS approval depends on the beneficiary's location and completion of all procedural steps. If DOS determines a beneficiary is ineligible, they issue a \"consular return\" to USCIS for reconsideration. Denials can occur due to failure to establish eligibility, abandonment, or a combination of both, and petitioners cannot directly appeal but can file a motion to reopen or reconsider. Approved petitions for beneficiaries abroad require a transportation letter or boarding foil for travel. Cases can be administratively closed if a beneficiary fails to appear for an interview. Petitioners can withdraw their I-730 petitions before the beneficiary is admitted to the U.S. or granted derivative status, but withdrawals cannot be retracted.",

The choice of process depends on factors such as the child's country of residence, the petitioner's citizenship and residence, the date of any adoption or custody order, and the duration of the child's legal custody and residence with the petitioner.\n\nThe **Hague Adoption Convention process** generally applies to U.S. citizens adopting children habitually residing in Hague Convention countries, with adoptions occurring on or after April 1, 2008. Key considerations include habitual residence determinations for both the prospective adoptive parent and the child, and specific forms (I-800A and I-800) are required.\n\nThe **Orphan process** is for U.S. citizens adopting children not habitually resident in Hague Convention countries. Similar to the Hague process, it requires suitability and eligibility determinations, using forms I-600A and I-600.\n\nThe **Family-Based petition process** is available to U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs). It requires a final adoption before the child turned 16 (or 18 for siblings), and the child must have been in legal custody and resided jointly with the petitioner for at least two years.

A child can immigrate if they meet the definition of adoption for immigration, which requires the creation of a legal status comparable to that of a natural child, termination of prior parental rights, and establishment of a legal parent-child relationship with adoptive parents. The validity of an adoption is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the order was issued. USCIS may question an adoption if there is evidence of flaws in its execution, corruption, fraud, or a fraudulent document. The document also discusses various types of adoption, including judicial, administrative, customary, and simple adoptions, and how they are evaluated for immigration purposes. It clarifies that ongoing contact with birth parents (open adoptions) does not invalidate an adoption if adoptive parents exercise full authority. Special considerations are given to adoptive stepparents. The petitioner bears the burden of proving the adoption's validity and the applicable law, often requiring evidence such as copies of relevant laws and translations. If an adoption is deemed valid, the adoptee is considered the child of the adoptive parents for immigration, precluding birth parents from petitioning through the child. The document also touches on the legal termination of an adoption and its effect on re-establishing relationships. Several resources and legal references are provided.

      "summary": "This document outlines Chapter 1 of the USCIS Policy Manual concerning the purpose and background of the orphan immigration process. The primary goal of this legislation is to ensure the welfare of orphaned children immigrating to the U.S. through adoption. The orphan process is one of three adoption-based immigration pathways and generally applies when a child is not habitually residing in a Hague Adoption Convention Country and at least one prospective adoptive parent (PAP) is a U.S. citizen. The process involves USCIS determining the suitability and eligibility of the PAPs, as well as the child's eligibility to immigrate.\n\nHistorically, the Displaced Persons Act of 1948 first addressed orphan immigration. Subsequent legislation, including the Intercountry Adoption Universal Accreditation Act of 2012 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, has updated requirements for adoption service providers and modified the definition of an orphan to facilitate immigration. Key legal authorities and resources, including specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), are provided, along with links to relevant forms and guidance. The document also notes recent technical updates to the Policy Manual, including terminology changes and the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

The child must meet age and identity requirements, as well as specific eligibility criteria for orphans. A qualifying adoptive or custodial relationship must exist between the child and a U.S. citizen parent. Additionally, the process prohibits child-buying, fraud, misrepresentation, or non-bona fide intent.

      "summary": "This chapter outlines the eligibility requirements for a child to be classified as an orphan under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) for immigration purposes. A child is considered an orphan if they either have no legal parents (due to death, disappearance, abandonment, desertion, separation, or loss) or have a sole or surviving legal parent who is incapable of providing proper care.\n\nThe chapter details the specific definitions and criteria for each of these categories:\n\n*   **Abandonment:** Willfully forsaking all parental rights, obligations, and control without intending to transfer them to a specific person. This excludes releases to authorized third parties for adoption or temporary placements in orphanages with expressed intent to retrieve the child.\n*   **Desertion:** Willfully forsaking the child and refusing parental duties, leading to the child becoming a ward of a competent authority.\n*   **Disappearance:** Parents have inexplicably disappeared, their whereabouts are unknown, and there is no reasonable hope of their reappearance, with efforts to locate them verified by a competent authority.\n*   **Loss:** Permanent, involuntary severance from parents due to events beyond their control, such as natural disasters or civil unrest, verified by a competent authority.\n*   **Death:** One or both parents are legally deceased, and the child has not acquired another legal parent.\n*   **Separation:** Involuntary and permanent termination of parental rights by a competent authority for reasons like abuse or neglect, following proper notification and opportunity for parents to contest.\n\nIt also clarifies the conditions for a **Sole or Surviving Parent**, emphasizing the birth mother's status and the requirements for the father's absence or incapacity.\n\nFurthermore, the document addresses **Other Legal Parents**, including stepparents, and the process for determining their legal relationship and rights to the child under foreign law. The burden is on the prospective adoptive parent (PAP) to demonstrate if a stepparent has no legal parental rights.\n\nFinally, the chapter lists relevant **Resources** such as U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) sections, as well as USCIS forms and policy manual updates.",

To qualify, a PAP must have either a final adoption granted by the foreign-sending country or legal custody of the child for emigration and adoption in the U.S.\n\n**Final Adoption:**\nFor a foreign adoption to be considered \"full and final\" for U.S. immigration purposes, it must:\n*   Meet USCIS requirements (valid in the foreign country, create a legal permanent parent-child relationship, and terminate prior relationships).\n*   The petitioner(s) must have adopted the child.\n*   The petitioner(s) must have personally seen and observed the child before or during the adoption proceedings abroad.\n\nIf these criteria are met, the child may be eligible for an IR-3 visa. Proxy adoptions, where parents do not see the child, do not qualify for an IR-3 visa but may allow for an IR-4 visa if the adoption is otherwise valid and the child will be adopted in the U.S.\n\n**Legal Custody for Emigration and Adoption:**\nIf a foreign country does not grant what USCIS considers a \"final adoption\" for immigration, a child may still qualify based on legal custody if:\n*   The PAP secured legal custody according to the foreign country's laws.\n*   The entity with custody irrevocably released the child for emigration and adoption.\n*   The PAP complies with U.S. state pre-adoption requirements.\n*   If the foreign adoption wasn't \"full and final,\" the child's intended U.S. state of residence must allow re-adoption or recognize the foreign adoption.\n\nIf these criteria are met, the child may be eligible for an IR-4 visa to be adopted in the U.S.",

If not, a Request for Evidence (RFE) for an updated home study may be issued.\n*   **Primary adoption service provider:** PAPs must identify a primary adoption service provider, unless an exception applies.

PAPs are advised to file with USCIS in the U.S. before traveling. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) can accept petitions but forwards them to USCIS for a preliminary determination. PAPs must submit specific documentation, including evidence of adoption availability from Taiwan, an adoption agreement, and a power of attorney. If USCIS makes a favorable preliminary determination, a PAIR letter is issued. This is not a final decision. USCIS then sends the file to AIT. After adoption or custody is granted, the PAP provides the adoption decree/custody order and identity documents to AIT. AIT makes the final orphan petition approval. If AIT finds the petition not clearly approvable, it's returned to USCIS.\n\nThe chapter also includes a list of **Resources**, such as relevant CFR and INA sections, forms like I-600 and I-600A, and procedural guidance.

Certificates of Citizenship are generally issued automatically for children entering with IR-3 or IH-3 visas, while others may need to file Form N-600.\n\nFor children residing outside the U.S. (INA 322), eligibility requires meeting similar adoption criteria, having a U.S. citizen parent or grandparent with specific physical presence in the U.S., residing in the U.S. citizen parent's custody (or a designated guardian if the parent is deceased), and being lawfully admitted to the U.S. An application (Form N-600K) must be filed on behalf of the child.\n\nThe document also covers historical provisions for citizenship acquisition for adopted children prior to February 27, 2001, detailing different scenarios based on when the adoption or naturalization of parents occurred.

They can request a Certificate of Citizenship if they lack documentation or apply for a U.S. passport.

A labor certification is not required, but the beneficiary must have been employed abroad by a related organization for at least one year within the last three years.

Branch offices of foreign employers and sole proprietorships cannot petition. \"Doing business\" is defined as the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods or services. Both the U.S. employer and the foreign entity must continue to do business until visa issuance or adjustment of status.\n\nBeneficiary requirements focus on managerial or executive capacity. \"Managerial capacity\" includes personnel managers who primarily supervise and control other employees, and function managers who primarily manage an \"essential function\" without necessarily supervising staff. \"Executive capacity\" involves directing management, establishing goals and policies, exercising discretionary decision-making, and receiving general supervision.

This includes possessing or being eligible for a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in the intended U.S. state or territory. The process for obtaining a license varies by state and can involve initial applications or applications by endorsement, requiring verification of credentials and potentially passing state-specific medical examinations. Foreign medical degrees may be considered equivalent to U.S. medical degrees if specific conditions related to admission requirements, credential evaluation, or passing national medical examinations are met.\n\nThe **Physician National Interest Waiver (NIW)** allows certain physicians to bypass the labor certification process if they agree to work full-time in an area designated as having a healthcare professional shortage or at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility, and their work is deemed to be in the public interest by a federal agency or state public health department. This waiver is established under the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999. Physicians granted an NIW must complete a specified period of service (typically 3 or 5 years) to maintain their status, though they can adjust their status before completing the full service. Eligibility extends to both primary and specialty care physicians. To support an NIW petition, physicians must provide evidence such as an employment contract, a public interest letter, and proof of admissibility, which includes passing professional medical examinations and demonstrating English language competency. USCIS allows for flexibility in changing practice locations or facilities under certain conditions, requiring an amended petition.\n\nRecent updates reflect a technical initiative to move policy guidance from the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) into the USCIS Policy Manual, consolidating existing guidance and removing obsolete information.

      "summary": "Chapter 2 of the USCIS Policy Manual outlines the eligibility requirements for immigrant investor petitions (EB-5). The core requirements involve an investment of capital, engagement in a new commercial enterprise, and job creation. The chapter details specific criteria and variations based on petition filing dates and program types (standalone vs. Regional Center).\n\n**Key elements include:**\n\n*   **Investment of Capital:**\n    *   \"Capital\" is broadly defined to include cash, equipment, inventory, tangible property, cash equivalents, and certain secured indebtedness.\n    *   As of May 14, 2022, gifts and loans are expressly permitted as capital under specific conditions.\n    *   Promissory notes can qualify as capital if the investor is personally liable and the note is adequately secured by assets not part of the enterprise.\n    *   The capital must be valued at fair market value and obtained through lawful means.\n    *   Investments must be \"at risk\" and cannot involve guaranteed returns or pre-arranged repayment agreements (debt arrangements), though some exceptions exist for investor-exercised options and certain buy-back options by the enterprise.\n    *   The full investment amount must be made available to the business(es) responsible for job creation.\n*   **New Commercial Enterprise:**\n    *   Must be established after November 29, 1990, or be a restructured/expanded existing business meeting specific criteria (40% increase in net worth or employees).\n    *   Must be a for-profit activity for the ongoing conduct of lawful business.\n    *   Can include holding companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries.\n    *   Pooled investments are permitted for standalone investors before March 15, 2022, and only under the Regional Center Program thereafter.\n*   **Job Creation:**\n    *   The investment must directly or indirectly create at least 10 full-time positions for qualifying employees.\n    *   Qualifying employees are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or other lawfully authorized workers (excluding the investor and their immediate family).\n    *   Full-time employment requires a minimum of 35 working hours per week, and job sharing is permitted if this requirement is met.\n    *   \"Troubled businesses\" can have job preservation count towards the requirement.\n    *   Regional Center programs allow for indirect job creation through reasonable economic methodologies. Construction jobs may have limitations on how they count.\n*   **Investment Amount:**\n    *   Minimum investment amounts vary based on the filing date and whether the investment is in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA).\n    *   Pre-March 15, 2022: $1,000,000 standard, $500,000 in TEA.\n    *   On or after March 15, 2022: $1,050,000 standard, $800,000 in TEA or infrastructure project, with future automatic increases.\n*   **Targeted Employment Area (TEA):**\n    *   Defined as a rural area or an area with high unemployment (at least 150% of the national average rate for petitions before March 15, 2022).\n    *   Specific criteria and evidence are required to demonstrate TEA status.\n*   **Business Plan:**\n    *   A comprehensive and credible business plan is required, detailing the business, market analysis, objectives, and financial projections.\n*   **Management Engagement:**\n    *   The immigrant investor must be engaged in the management of the new commercial enterprise, either through day-to-day management or policy formulation.\n*   **Lawful Source of Funds:**\n    *   Investors must prove their capital was obtained through lawful means, providing extensive documentation of income, gifts, loans, and business records.\n*   **Infrastructure Projects:**\n    *   For regional center petitions filed on or after May 14, 2022, investment in qualifying government-administered infrastructure projects can qualify for the reduced investment amount.\n\nThe chapter also details the burden of proof, priority dates, and provides extensive footnotes and resources for further information. Updates indicate ongoing changes and interpretations, particularly related to the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022.",

      "summary": "Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual, titled \"Regional Center Applications,\" details the requirements and processes for entities seeking to operate as a Regional Center under the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. The primary goal of this program is to stimulate economic growth within a defined geographic area by pooling investments from immigrant investors.\n\n**Key aspects covered include:**\n\n*   **Application Process:** Entities must submit Form I-956 for regional center designation, accompanied by Form I-956H for individuals involved. Designated regional centers then use Form I-956F for each specific investment offering, allowing investors to file Form I-526E.\n*   **Eligibility Criteria:** Regional centers must operate within a defined, contiguous, and limited geographic area and demonstrate a substantive economic impact on that area.\n*   **Documentation and Evidence:** Applications require detailed economic and statistical forecasts regarding investment, commercial enterprises, job creation, and positive economic effects. They must also include descriptions of policies and procedures for monitoring compliance with laws and program requirements, and attestations for all involved individuals.\n*   **Persons Involved:** The chapter defines who is considered \"involved\" with a regional center, new commercial enterprise, or job-creating entity, emphasizing those in positions of substantive authority. It outlines eligibility requirements for these individuals, including U.S. national or lawful permanent resident status, and restrictions on foreign government entities. It also details disqualifications based on past offenses, regulatory violations, illicit activities, and disciplinary actions.\n*   **Geographic Area:** Applicants must clearly define, map, and justify the contiguous and limited geographic area, demonstrating linkages between economic activities through variables like regional connectivity and labor pools.\n*   **Reasonable Predictions:** Applicants must provide evidence and use valid forecasting tools to predict the investment's pooling amount, commercial enterprise types, job creation, and other positive economic impacts.\n*   **Policies and Procedures:** Detailed descriptions of policies and procedures for monitoring commercial enterprises and ensuring compliance with federal and state laws, including EB-5 program rules, are required.\n*   **Adjudication:** Applications are either approved if eligibility standards are met or denied with clear grounds for refusal and information on appeal rights. USCIS can deny applications based on fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, criminal misuse, or if approval is contrary to national interest.\n*   **Amendments:** Designated regional centers must notify USCIS of significant changes in organizational structure, ownership, or administration, with specific timelines for notification.\n*   **Record-Keeping and Audits:** Regional centers must maintain records for five years to support annual statements and investor petitions. USCIS audits each regional center at least once every five years.\n*   **Annual Statements:** Regional centers must submit an annual statement (Form I-956G) detailing compliance, financial accounting, and project progress, including job creation figures and fee collections.\n*   **Integrity Fund:** Regional centers must pay an annual fee to the EB-5 Integrity Fund, with the amount based on the number of investors. The policy clarifies how \"investors\" are counted for fee calculation purposes.\n*   **Terminations, Suspensions, and Sanctions:** USCIS can impose sanctions, including fines, temporary suspension, permanent bar, or termination of designation, for various violations such as failure to submit annual statements, improper involvement of individuals, or non-compliance with audits. Specific violations are detailed, including those that mandate termination.\n*   **Previous Policies:** The \"Appendices\" section notes that some content reflects policies prior to the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 and references the use of Form I-924 for older applications. It outlines requirements for regional center proposals, including management plans and geographic area definitions. It also differentiates between hypothetical projects, actual projects, and exemplar filings, each with varying levels of required detail and deference in adjudication. Annual reporting via Form I-924A and procedures for amendments and terminations are also covered.\n*   **Updates:** The \"Updates\" section indicates various technical and policy changes over time, including updates related to the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, terminology changes (e.g., \"noncitizen\" to \"alien\"), and alignment with court decisions and regulatory updates.",

      "summary": "Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual focuses on the \"Removal of Conditions\" for EB-5 immigrant investors. Key information includes:\n\n**Alerts and Legal Context:**\n*   An alert from June 22, 2021, notes that the Behring Regional Center LLC v. Wolf case vacated the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program Modernization Final Rule. USCIS is applying regulations in effect before November 21, 2019, including specific investment amounts and priority date rules.\n*   Another alert highlights the enactment of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 on March 15, 2022, authorizing the Regional Center Program through September 30, 2027. USCIS is updating guidance accordingly.\n\n**Form I-829 (Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions):**\n*   Immigrant investors must file Form I-829 within 90 days before their 2-year anniversary of conditional permanent resident status.\n*   **Required Evidence:**\n    *   Proof that the required capital was invested or actively being invested and sustained throughout the conditional residence period.\n    *   Evidence that the new commercial enterprise created or is expected to create at least 10 full-time positions for qualifying employees. For troubled businesses, evidence of maintaining employee numbers at the pre-investment level is required.\n\n**Evidence of Investment and Sustainment:**\n*   **Investment:** Evidence of investing or actively processing the investment of requisite capital (e.g., audited financial statements).\n*   **Sustainment:** Evidence of maintaining the investment throughout the conditional residence period. Substantial compliance in good faith is generally sufficient, meaning the full amount doesn't need to be invested, but substantial progress must be shown (e.g., bank statements, invoices, contracts, tax returns).\n\n**Evidence of Job Creation:**\n*   At least 10 full-time positions must be created or expected to be created.\n*   **Direct Jobs:** For non-regional center investors, direct job creation is required (e.g., payroll records, I-9 forms).\n*   **Indirect Jobs:** For regional center investors, direct or indirect jobs can be shown using methodologies like multiplier tables or feasibility studies.\n*   **Troubled Businesses:** Evidence of maintaining employment levels at the time of investment and petition filing is needed.\n*   **Job Allocation:** Full-time positions are allocated based on the filing date of the Form I-829, with the first filers getting priority for job counts.\n*   **Definition of Full-time:** The criterion focuses on the position, not the employee. Jobs expected to last at least 2 years generally qualify, even in seasonal industries, as long as the position is continuous. Construction jobs expected to last several years qualify, while short-term specialized roles might not.\n*   **Reasonable Time Standard:** Jobs can be shown to be created within a reasonable period (generally within 2 years of admission, potentially up to 3 years in exceptional circumstances). The business plan must show a likelihood of job creation within 2 years.\n\n**Material Change:**\n*   USCIS allows flexibility if circumstances change from the original Form I-526 business plan. Petitions are not denied solely for deviating from the plan.\n*   The investment can be deployed differently, as long as the capital remains at risk and other requirements are met.\n*   The initial Form I-526 must have been filed in good faith.\n*   Key requirements that must always be demonstrated: capital at risk, capital made available to job-creating businesses, sustainment of investment, and creation/maintenance of jobs.\n\n**Extension of Conditional Permanent Residence:**\n*   Filing a Form I-829 extends the validity of conditional permanent resident status. The receipt notice (Form I-797) serves as proof of status, employment authorization, and travel authorization.\n*   If further documentation is needed, applicants can schedule an appointment with USCIS to obtain an ADIT stamp (I-551) on their I-94 or passport.\n*   Denied Form I-829 petitions can be reviewed in removal proceedings, and a temporary I-551 is issued until the order of removal is final.\n\n**Regional Centers:**\n*   The Appendices section provides information that existed *before* the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022.\n*   Regional centers aim to stimulate economic growth and can facilitate indirect job creation.\n*   Regional center designation requires a proposal (Form I-924) detailing geographic focus, job creation plans, capital sources, promotional efforts, and economic impact predictions supported by valid forecasting tools.\n*   Proposals can be for \"hypothetical\" projects (general proposals sufficient for designation, but no deference in subsequent filings) or \"actual\" projects (require more detail and verifiable plans, receive deference). \"Exemplar\" filings with an I-526 provide even greater detail and deference.\n*   Designated regional centers must file an annual report (Form I-924A).\n*   Regional centers can amend their designations (e.g., to expand geographic area), which must be approved by USCIS.\n*   USCIS can issue a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) if a regional center fails to serve its purpose or submit required information. Termination can occur if allegations are not overcome.\n\n**Updates:**\n*   Recent updates reflect technical changes in terminology (e.g., \"alien\" vs. \"noncitizen\") and the incorporation of statutory reforms related to regional centers, job creation, and capital requirements.",

      "summary": "Chapter 8 of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) outlines USCIS's authority to impose sanctions (suspensions, debarments, terminations) on EB-5 program participants for noncompliance. The general process involves USCIS issuing a notice of intent to sanction, allowing a response period (typically 30 days), and then issuing a final notice if sanctions are warranted. Factors considered in determining the severity of a sanction include previous violations, willfulness, attempts at compliance, harm to the program's integrity, cooperation with agencies, and for entities, their risk management and training. Sanctions become final after the appeal period or decision.\n\n**Types of Sanctions:**\n*   **Suspensions:** Temporary prohibition from some or all EB-5 program participation, lasting until a specified date or until the violation is cured. A suspended regional center's designation is not terminated, but it must still comply with program requirements.\n*   **Debarments:** Typically permanently prevent participation in the EB-5 program. USCIS interprets its authority to terminate the participation of new commercial enterprises or job-creating entities as equivalent to debarment. Debarment can be based on noncompliance or prohibited conduct, and USCIS may permanently debar individuals or entities knowingly involved in conduct leading to a termination or debarment. Investors affected by a debarment have 180 days to reassociate with a new entity.\n*   **Terminations:** For regional centers, termination means they are no longer designated and cannot solicit investors or file project applications. Affected investors also have 180 days to reassociate.\n\n**Discretionary Determinations:**\nUSCIS may deny or revoke EB-5 related petitions if approval is contrary to the national interest due to threats to public safety or national security, or if the petition involves fraud, deceit, intentional material misrepresentation, or criminal misuse. Discretionary decisions must not be arbitrary.\n\n*   **National Interest Grounds:** Threats to public safety include aggravated felonies. National security concerns relate to activities described in INA sections concerning general security, terrorist activities, or association with terrorist organizations.\n*   **Fraud and Related Grounds:** This includes fraud, intentional material misrepresentation, deceit, and criminal misuse. USCIS interprets these terms broadly, not limited to misrepresentations made against the U.S. government.\n    *   **Fraud:** Knowingly making a false representation or concealing a material fact with intent to deceive or induce action.\n    *   **Intentional Material Misrepresentation:** Making a false or misleading assertion about a material fact with intent to deceive.\n    *   **Deceit:** Intentionally leading another person to believe something untrue.\n    *   **Criminal Misuse:** Improperly using the EB-5 program or its capital in connection with or furtherance of a crime, most commonly financial crimes.\n\nExamples of actions triggering these grounds include financial fraud, falsified job creation claims, intentional misrepresentation or omission of information, misrepresenting the EB-5 program to investors, misrepresenting fund sources, and assuming false identities.\n\n**Regional Center Program Specifics:**\nThe chapter also details aspects of the Regional Center Program, including the requirements for regional center proposals (Form I-924), the distinction between hypothetical and actual projects, the use of exemplar filings for compliance review, annual reporting requirements (Form I-924A), and procedures for amendments and termination of regional center designations. When a regional center is terminated or debarred, affected investors have 180 days to reassociate with a new entity to potentially preserve their eligibility.",

      "summary": "Chapter 2 of the USCIS Policy Manual outlines the terms and conditions for Conditional Permanent Residents (CPRs). CPR status is granted for two years to individuals who obtain permanent residence through a marriage that was less than two years old at the time of application. To maintain this status, CPRs must file a Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) within a 90-day window before their second anniversary. Failure to do so results in automatic termination of their status.\n\nUSCIS provides notification of these obligations, both initially and through a reminder mailed approximately 90 days before the anniversary. The chapter also details rules regarding dependent children of CPRs, clarifying when children are subject to or exempt from CPR conditions and how they should file their petitions.\n\nPermanent residents not classified as CPRs include those whose marriages were over two years old at the time of admission, those obtaining residence on a basis other than marriage, and accompanying dependents of principal beneficiaries. The document also addresses misclassified CPRs, who should file Form I-90 to correct their status.\n\nEvidence of CPR status includes the receipt notice for Form I-751, which extends the validity of their status. For temporary evidence of status when cards and extensions have expired, CPRs can request an ADIT stamp from a USCIS field office.\n\nTermination of CPR status can occur before or after the two-year anniversary. Before the anniversary, termination may result from USCIS determining the marriage was improper. After the anniversary, termination typically results from failure to file Form I-751, failure to appear for an interview, or denial of the Form I-751. Upon termination, CPRs are generally placed in removal proceedings.\n\nThe chapter also clarifies that CPRs are generally ineligible to adjust status on a new basis while in the U.S. and in lawful CPR status, though there are exceptions if their CPR status is terminated.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources, including specific INA sections, forms, and other USCIS guidance documents, and notes recent technical updates regarding terminology changes.",

      "summary": "This chapter details the process for Conditional Permanent Residents (CPRs) to remove conditions on their residence, primarily through filing Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence.\n\n**Key aspects include:**\n\n*   **Establishing a Bona Fide Marriage:** CPRs must prove their qualifying marriage was genuine. Evidence can include joint property ownership, leases, commingled finances, birth certificates of children, and third-party affidavits. The marriage must be legally valid, not judicially annulled or terminated (except by death), not entered into for immigration purposes, and without payment or consideration for filing the visa petition.\n*   **Basis for Filing:** CPRs can file jointly with their spouse if the marriage is ongoing. Individual filing is possible in cases of widowhood, divorce/annulment, battery/extreme cruelty by the spouse, or if removal would cause extreme hardship. Children can also file separately if not included on a parent's petition.\n*   **Filing Requirements:** Joint petitions must be filed within the 90 days before the second anniversary of obtaining CPR status. Late filings require a showing of good cause and extenuating circumstances. Individual filings and waiver requests can be made anytime before a final removal order. Proper filing requires the correct form, fee, signature, and evidence of a bona fide marriage (unless a waiver is sought).\n*   **Military and Government Personnel:** Special provisions exist for CPRs or their spouses/stepparents serving overseas on military or government orders, potentially extending filing deadlines or waiving interview requirements. Extensive military-specific documentation can serve as strong evidence of a bona fide marriage.\n*   **Pending Naturalization:** USCIS adjudicates the I-751 concurrently with or before a pending naturalization application (Form N-400), though there are limited exceptions where an I-751 may not be required before naturalization.\n*   **Standard of Proof:** The standard is a preponderance of the evidence. USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) or schedule an interview if initial evidence is insufficient.\n*   **Interview:** CPRs generally must attend an interview unless waived by USCIS. Waivers are considered if sufficient evidence exists, there's no indication of fraud, and no complex issues require resolution. Failure to appear for a required interview can lead to denial.\n*   **Rebuttal and Fraud:** CPRs have opportunities to rebut derogatory information or suspected fraud through interviews or written responses to RFEs or Notices of Intent to Deny (NOID).

      "summary": "Chapter 4 of the USCIS Policy Manual, titled \"Joint Petitions and Individual Filing Requests,\" details the process for Conditional Permanent Residents (CPRs) to remove conditions on their residence.\n\n**A. Joint Petitions:**\nCPRs married to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident file Form I-751 jointly within 90 days before their second anniversary of conditional status. An exception exists for those overseas on military or government orders, where the 90-day period is suspended. Joint petitions require proof of a bona fide marriage. Separation or divorce proceedings do not automatically deny a joint petition, but a finalized divorce before adjudication renders the CPR ineligible for a joint petition, though they may request to amend it to a waiver. Insufficient evidence may lead to a Request for Evidence (RFE) or an interview.\n\n**B. Deceased Petitioning Spouse:**\nIf the petitioning spouse dies after the CPR obtains conditional status, the CPR can file Form I-751 individually, without needing a waiver. This is considered an individual filing request. If the death occurs before filing, the CPR indicates this on Form I-751 and provides proof of death. If the death occurs after filing a joint petition but before adjudication, the CPR must notify USCIS and provide proof of death, after which USCIS will amend the joint petition. In all cases involving a deceased spouse, the CPR must still establish that the marriage was bona fide. The adjudication process for individual filing requests is similar to joint petitions, and insufficient evidence may result in an RFE or interview.\n\nThe chapter also lists relevant resources, including various sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), forms, and USCIS policy documents. There are no appendices available. Recent updates indicate technical changes in terminology and the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the process and criteria for Conditional Permanent Residents (CPRs) to request a waiver of the joint filing requirement on Form I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence.\n\nCPRs can request a waiver at any time before or during the 90-day period before their second anniversary of conditional permanent resident status, or even before this period begins if eligible. However, those in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings must apply before a final order is issued.\n\nWaiver requests can be based on one or more of the following circumstances:\n*   **Extreme Hardship:** Removal from the U.S. would result in extreme hardship. This waiver considers circumstances that occurred during the two years following admission to the U.S. for conditional permanent residence, or circumstances that began before this period but continued into it. Good faith of the marriage is not a requirement for this waiver, though it can be a discretionary factor.\n*   **Good Faith Marriage (Divorce/Annulment):** The qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith but has since been terminated by divorce or annulment. The CPR must prove the marriage was bona fide and not for immigration fraud. Evidence includes financial commingling, cohabitation, and children. The CPR is not considered at fault for the termination of the marriage for waiver purposes. Separation without a final divorce or annulment does not qualify for this waiver.\n*   **Battery or Extreme Cruelty:** The CPR spouse or child was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by the petitioning spouse. This includes physical, psychological, sexual abuse, or exploitation. CPR children can also apply if their parent (the CPR spouse) or stepparent subjected them to abuse. This waiver is available even if the CPR is still married to the abuser. Special provisions, including \"any credible evidence\" and confidentiality protections, apply to these cases.\n\nCPRs can generally change or add waiver bases, but specific procedures apply to battery or extreme cruelty cases, and in some instances, a new Form I-751 may be required. When filing a waiver, the CPR must submit evidence supporting the basis for the waiver and evidence that the marriage was not entered into for immigration purposes (unless filing solely on extreme hardship). USCIS has sole discretion in determining the credibility and weight of evidence.\n\nThe document also lists various resources, including relevant sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), USCIS forms, and policy manual guidance.

      "summary": "Chapter 6 of the USCIS Policy Manual outlines the decision-making process for petitions to remove conditions on residence (Form I-751), covering approvals, denials, and post-adjudication actions.\n\n**Key aspects include:**\n\n*   **Discretion:** Decisions on joint filings are generally non-discretionary, focusing solely on INA 216 eligibility and the bona fides of the marriage. However, waiver requests are discretionary and can consider factors beyond marital bona fides.\n*   **Approvals:** Approved petitions result in the removal of conditions on residence, effective from the second anniversary of obtaining permanent resident status. A new Permanent Resident Card is issued.\n*   **Denials:** Denials occur if eligibility is not established by a preponderance of the evidence. Common reasons include abandonment of the petition (failure to respond, appear for biometrics, or attend interviews), an improper qualifying marriage, or failure to establish eligibility. Discretionary denials can also occur for waiver requests based on significant negative factors.\n*   **Withdrawals:** A joint petition is considered withdrawn if support is withdrawn before adjudication. In such cases, the conditional permanent resident (CPR) is typically placed in removal proceedings but may file a waiver application. If only the petitioning spouse withdraws, the CPR is given an opportunity to amend the filing basis to a waiver.\n*   **Notification:** USCIS provides written notice of decisions, including reasons for denial and instructions for further action.\n*   **Motions and Appeals:** CPRs can file a motion to reopen or reconsider (Form I-290B) or a new Form I-751 if they disagree with a denial or have additional evidence. The filing basis can sometimes be amended on a motion.\n*   **Multiple Filings:** There are no limits on the number of times a CPR can file Form I-751. USCIS reviews prior filings when adjudicating new ones, with specific procedures for handling cases with the same or different filing bases, or when a prior petition is still pending.\n\nThe chapter also lists relevant resources, including statutory references, forms, and procedural guidance.

The petition must be adjudicated by USCIS before an immigration judge (IJ) can review it.\n*   **Filing Waivers:** A CPR can file a waiver for the first time while in removal proceedings if they become eligible at that time, but it must be filed with USCIS.\n*   **No Automatic Denial:** USCIS does not deny or hold a Form I-751 solely because the CPR is in removal proceedings.\n*   **Expedited Adjudication:** USCIS expedites adjudication if an IJ has administratively closed proceedings to await a USCIS decision.\n*   **Review in Removal Proceedings:** A CPR can seek review of a denied joint petition or individual filing request before an IJ. If the CPR status was terminated by USCIS under INA 216, they are removable.\n*   **Burden of Proof:** In denial cases, DHS must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the marriage was fraudulent or improperly terminated. The CPR must prove compliance with filing and interview requirements if the denial was due to missed appointments or failure to file.\n*   **Waiver Review:** A CPR can seek review of a denied waiver before an IJ.\n*   **Final Order of Removal:** If a CPR is subject to a final order of removal, their CPR status is terminated, and any Form I-751 filed will be denied.",

      "summary": "Chapter 1 of the provided document outlines the purpose and background of Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status and the process of adjustment of status in the United States.\n\n**Purpose of LPR Status:**\nLPR status grants significant rights and responsibilities, including permanent residency (unless removable), the ability to work legally, protection under U.S. laws, and the obligation to obey laws, file taxes, support the government, register with the Selective Service (if applicable), petition for family members, and eventually apply for citizenship.\n\n**Paths to LPR Status:**\nThere are two main pathways:\n1.  **Consular Processing:** For individuals outside the U.S. who have approved immigrant petitions. They apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. consulate abroad and, if admissible, are admitted as LPRs.\n2.  **Adjustment of Status:** For individuals already present in the U.S. with approved immigrant petitions. They can apply with USCIS to adjust their status to LPR without leaving the country. This provision was created to reduce the expense and inconvenience of overseas travel, and has been expanded to support national security, economic growth, family unity, and humanitarian resettlement.\n\n**Background of Adjustment of Status:**\nAdjustment of status is the process by which an alien obtains LPR status while in the U.S., receiving a permanent resident card (green card) upon approval. Most approvals are based on family or employment relationships, with the focus on the applicant's eligibility and admissibility.\n\n**Historical Overview of Immigration Laws:**\n*   **Early Immigration:** Prior to the late 19th century, immigration was largely unregulated. Early restrictions focused on barring \"undesirable\" immigrants (e.g., criminals, those with diseases).\n*   **1920s:** The National Origins Quota System introduced numerical restrictions, limiting immigration from each country based on a percentage of foreign-born residents from that nationality in 1910.\n*   **Pre-1952:** Laws required immigrants to obtain visas abroad and enter the U.S. There was no process for those already in the U.S. to become permanent residents without departing. The \"pre-examination\" process was developed by 1935, allowing eligible aliens in the U.S. to obtain a visa abroad and return as permanent residents. The Alien Registration Act of 1940 required registration and fingerprinting of foreign-born individuals.\n*   **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952:** Consolidated existing immigration laws, retaining qualitative and numerical restrictions. It modified the National Origins Quota System and introduced preference categories for family and employment-based immigration. Crucially, the INA provided the first formal procedure for aliens temporarily in the U.S. to adjust their status to permanent resident without traveling abroad.\n*   **Post-1952 Developments:**\n    *   **1965 Amendments:** Abolished the National Origins Quota System, established separate quotas for hemispheres, and revised the preference system for family and employment-based immigration, adding a refugee category.\n    *   **1976 & 1978 Amendments:** Combined hemisphere quotas into a single worldwide quota system with per-country limits.\n    *   **Refugee Act of 1980:** Established a separate refugee program and adopted the UN definition of \"refugee.\"\n    *   **Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986:** Provided a pathway for some agricultural workers and long-term undocumented residents, enhanced border enforcement, and mandated employer verification of work authorization (I-9 program).\n    *   **Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments (IMFA) of 1986:** Introduced conditional permanent residence for marriages less than two years old to deter fraud.\n*   **Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90):** Significantly increased immigration quotas, established new preference categories for family and employment-based immigration (including investors), created the Diversity Visa Program, introduced new nonimmigrant visa categories (O, P, Q, R), and expanded grounds of inadmissibility.\n*   **1996 Laws:** The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) focused on border control, worksite enforcement, removal of deportable aliens, introduced \"unlawful presence\" as an exclusion ground, expanded aggravated felony definitions, and limited judicial review.\n*   **Other Adjustment of Status Provisions:** Congress has also created specific adjustment programs outside the INA for narrowly defined groups.\n\n**Legal Authorities:**\nKey legal bases for adjustment of status include INA 245 and 8 CFR 245 (for general adjustment) and INA 209 and 8 CFR 209 (for adjustment of refugees).\n\n**Resources and Updates:**\nThe document lists relevant regulations, forms, and policy manual volumes.

This includes family-based, employment-based, diversity visa, special immigrant, trafficking victim, crime victim, asylee, Cuban Adjustment Act, and certain parolee adjustments.\n\n**Exercise of Discretion:**\n*   Approval of discretionary applications is an \"administrative grace,\" not an automatic entitlement.\n*   Applicants must demonstrate they warrant a favorable exercise of discretion by providing relevant information.\n*   Officers first assess statutory and regulatory eligibility.\n*   If eligible, officers weigh positive and negative factors based on the \"totality of the circumstances\" to determine if LPR status is in the best interest of the U.S.\n*   Negative factors, such as involvement with anti-American or terrorist organizations, are considered overwhelmingly negative.\n\n**Factors Considered in Discretionary Analysis:**\n*   **Positive Factors:** Meeting eligibility, strong family/community ties, long lawful residence, compliance with immigration laws, humanitarian petition approval, business/employment ties, education/skills, good moral character, honorable U.S. military service, tax compliance, cooperation with law enforcement, rehabilitation.\n*   **Negative Factors:** Not meeting eligibility, absence of ties, immigration violations, fraud/false testimony, unexecuted removal orders, history of unemployment/underemployment, unauthorized employment, illegal source of income, criminal record, lack of reformation, public safety/national security concerns, failure to meet financial obligations (taxes, child support).\n\n**Adjudication Summary:**\n*   **Eligibility Met & Discretion Warranted:** Approve.\n*   **Eligibility Met & Discretion Not Warranted:** Deny, explaining why discretion is not favored, detailing positive and negative factors.\n*   **Eligibility Not Met:** Deny, explaining failure to meet eligibility, regardless of discretion.\n*   **Eligibility Not Met & Discretion Not Warranted:** Deny, citing both reasons if appropriate.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources and updates to USCIS policy guidance concerning discretion.",

This bar does not apply to VAWA-based applicants.\n*   **Visa Waiver Programs:** Aliens admitted under a Visa Waiver Program or to Guam/CNMI without a visa are barred, except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens or VAWA-based applicants.\n*   **Alien Admitted as Witness or Informant:** Aliens admitted as S nonimmigrants are barred unless the requesting law enforcement agency initiates a special process for adjustment, or if they are VAWA-based applicants.\n*   **Alien Removable for Engagement in Terrorist Activity:** Individuals deportable for or associated with terrorist activity are barred.

This means they may be eligible to adjust status even if they have worked without authorization, are not in lawful status, have violated status terms, or entered via certain visa waiver programs.\n*   **Certain Special Immigrants:**\n    *   **Religious Workers:** Similar to immediate relatives, certain bars do not apply to religious workers adjusting status.\n    *   **Special Immigrant Juveniles:** Only the bar for involvement in terrorist activities applies; all other adjustment bars are waived.\n    *   **Afghanistan and Iraq Nationals:** Those who worked with U.S. forces or the U.S. government in Afghanistan or Iraq may adjust status even with certain unauthorized employment or status violations.\n    *   **G-4 International Organization Employees and NATO-6 Employees and Families:** While some bars still apply, certain adjustment bars are waived for these individuals.\n*   **Applicants Eligible under INA 245(i):** This section allows individuals ineligible or barred under INA 245(a) or 245(c) to adjust status.\n*   **Employment-Based Exemption under INA 245(k):** This exemption waives bars related to failure to maintain lawful status, unauthorized employment, or violation of nonimmigrant status terms, provided these violations aggregate to no more than 180 days *after the applicant's most recent lawful admission*. This exemption applies to specific employment-based categories (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3, EB-5, Religious Workers). Violations prior to the last lawful admission do not count towards the 180-day limit for this exemption.

      "summary": "The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC21) allows eligible employment-based adjustment of status applicants to change jobs or employers while their Form I-485 is pending. This \"portability\" provision, under INA 204(j), allows the underlying Form I-140 petition to remain valid if the new job offer is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the original petition.\n\nTo qualify for portability, applicants must meet several general requirements:\n*   Be the beneficiary of an approved or ultimately approvable Form I-140 petition in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd employment-based preference category.\n*   Have a properly filed adjustment application pending with USCIS for at least 180 days.\n*   The new job offer must be in the same or a similar occupational classification.\n*   A request to port must be submitted, typically using Form I-485, Supplement J, for requests made on or after January 17, 2017.\n\nKey considerations for portability include:\n*   **Approved Petition:** An approved Form I-140 remains valid for portability if the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days or more, unless substantively revoked.\n*   **Withdrawal of Petition:** If a petitioner withdraws a pending I-140, it may remain valid for portability if the petition is approvable and the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days or more. For approved petitions, withdrawal after 180 days generally allows for portability if other conditions are met.\n*   **Termination of Business:** Similar rules apply if the original petitioner's business terminates. Portability may be possible if the petition was approvable and the adjustment application has been pending for 180 days or more at the time of termination.\n*   **Same or Similar Occupational Classification:** This is determined by comparing job duties, titles, skills, education, and other factors, potentially referencing Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes. Career progression, including moves to managerial or supervisory roles, is also considered.\n*   **Requesting Portability:** Form I-485, Supplement J, is generally required to request portability. Applicants with a National Interest Waiver (NIW) or extraordinary ability are not tied to a specific job offer and thus do not need to file Supplement J.\n*   **Adjudication:** USCIS reviews the totality of the circumstances to determine if the new job is in the same or similar occupational classification. Approval of Supplement J allows the adjustment application adjudication to continue.\n*   **Death of Principal Beneficiary:** Derivative adjustment applicants may still be eligible to adjust status despite the principal applicant's death, and USCIS may approve or reinstate petitions regardless of portability considerations.",

      "summary": "Chapter 6 of the USCIS Policy Manual addresses the termination of refugee status and considerations for issuing a Notice to Appear (NTA). The sole basis for terminating a principal refugee's status is if they were not a refugee under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) at the time of admission, not due to changed country conditions. Derivative refugees' status is terminated only if the principal's status is terminated. Formal termination isn't always required before removal proceedings if a refugee is found inadmissible and doesn't receive a waiver. If an adjustment of status application is denied, the applicant can renew it before an Immigration Judge and may also apply for asylum or other relief. An NTA is issued if a refugee is inadmissible and their adjustment application is denied. Alternatively, USCIS can place a refugee directly into removal proceedings based on inadmissibility grounds without adjudicating an adjustment application.\n\nUSCIS handles the termination of refugee status. For cases at Service Centers, evidence is reviewed by a supervisor and forwarded to the International and Refugee Affairs Division (IRAD) for a recommendation. If IRAD recommends termination, the case is moved to a field office for an interview. For cases at Field Offices, evidence is reviewed by a supervisor and sent to headquarters and then to IRAD. If IRAD recommends termination, all family members' files are requested, and the principal refugee is interviewed. If IRAD does not recommend termination, no interview is needed.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources, including sections of the CFR and INA, the Refugee Act of 1980, and various USCIS forms and guidance documents.

USCIS policy does not initiate rescission if an immigration judge granted the adjustment.\n\nWhile conditional permanent residents (CPRs) are subject to the 5-year limitation, USCIS typically uses termination of status under INA 216 rather than rescission under INA 246 for CPRs. Termination of CPR status can occur if the qualifying marriage was improper, judicially annulled or terminated (unless by death), or if consideration was given for filing a petition. It can also occur if the CPR fails to file the I-751 petition, attend an interview, or if the I-751 is denied. USCIS may use rescission if a CPR was not eligible for adjustment but their status shouldn't be terminated under INA 216.\n\nEvents arising after adjustment do not subject a person to rescission, but may lead to removal proceedings.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for determining an alien's admissibility based on these health-related grounds, following HHS regulations.\n*   **Determination Process:** The document outlines a five-step process for officers to make health-related inadmissibility determinations, referencing specific chapters and sections within the USCIS Policy Manual for detailed information.\n*   **Legal Authorities:** Key legal statutes and regulations governing these health-related grounds are listed, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n*   **Resources and Updates:** Relevant resources, including legal citations and forms, are provided. The \"Updates\" section details various technical and policy revisions, including changes in terminology (e.g., \"alien\" vs. \"noncitizen\"), incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content, and updates based on revised CDC Technical Instructions for conditions like tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and syphilis.",

The chapter provides relevant legal resources, including 42 CFR 34, 42 U.S.C. 252, INA 212(a)(1), INA 221(d), INA 232, and 8 CFR 232, as well as USCIS forms like G-1055, G-28, and I-693. It also details how to use the USCIS Policy Manual website.\n\nThe \"Updates\" section highlights several technical changes to the Policy Manual. These include consistent replacement of terms like \"noncitizen,\" \"alien,\" and \"foreign national\" with more appropriate terminology, particularly concerning the definition of an \"alien\" under INA 101(a)(3). Additionally, there have been updates regarding the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual, with the Policy Manual taking precedence in case of conflict. Specific updates also address the validity period of Form I-693 and guidance on health-related grounds of inadmissibility, aligning with HHS rulemaking and providing information on corresponding waivers.

The chapter also explains that \"Class B conditions\" do not automatically render an applicant inadmissible on health grounds but may raise concerns about other inadmissibility grounds like public charge. It emphasizes the importance of complete medical documentation and the process for issuing a Request for Evidence (RFE) if forms are incomplete.\n\nThe document further clarifies that an applicant's own declaration of potential medical inadmissibility necessitates a medical examination. Officers retain the authority to order or reorder medical examinations if concerns arise from various sources, even if initial documentation appears clear. The chapter also addresses how medical information can inform decisions on other inadmissibility grounds, such as criminal grounds related to controlled substance violations, while clarifying that mere acknowledgments of drug use to a physician do not constitute a valid admission for inadmissibility purposes unless specific legal criteria are met.\n\nPrivacy concerns are highlighted, instructing officers to limit discussions of an applicant's medical issues to authorized individuals and to avoid direct contact with civil surgeons for issue resolution. Instead, RFEs should be used for unresolved concerns.

      "summary": "The applicability of medical examination and vaccination requirements for immigration benefits varies based on the specific benefit type. Generally, most applicants subject to inadmissibility on health grounds require a medical examination. However, certain applicants, like nonimmigrants, may only require an examination if there's a specific health concern. Immigration officers have the discretion to order a medical examination at any time if they suspect inadmissibility on health-related grounds, regardless of the benefit sought or the applicant's location.\n\nThe type of medical professional who performs the examination (civil surgeon in the U.S. or panel physician abroad) depends on where the benefit application is processed. A table outlines the specific requirements for various benefit types, including immigrant visas, adjustment of status, nonimmigrant visas, TPS, K and V visas, refugees, asylees, and others.\n\nSpecial considerations apply to nonimmigrants and TPS applicants, who typically only undergo a medical exam if health-related inadmissibility is suspected. K or V visa applicants are encouraged to comply with vaccination requirements, but denial of the visa for non-compliance is not permitted. For those adjusting status after obtaining K or V visas, a repeat medical exam may not be necessary if the original exam was recent and did not reveal a Class A medical condition, or if a waiver was granted and complied with. Refugees adjusting status generally do not need to repeat a medical exam if previously examined by a panel physician, unless a Class A condition was identified. However, they must undergo a new vaccination assessment by a civil surgeon. Asylees adjusting status also require a medical exam and vaccination assessment, though dependents may use previous overseas examination results under specific conditions. Certain Afghan nationals arriving during Operation Allies Welcome may use prior examinations for adjustment of status.\n\nChildren of returning residents and U.S. nationals entering the U.S. are exempt from medical examination and vaccination requirements. Internationally adopted orphans under a certain age may also be exempt from vaccination requirements before admission.\n\nRecent updates to the policy manual include the removal of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement and changes in terminology. USCIS is also updating guidance regarding medical examinations for Afghan nationals who arrived under Operation Allies Welcome and the validity period for Form I-693.",

The civil surgeon can only sign after the examination and any necessary treatment for a Class A condition is complete. Applicant signatures depend on age and mental competency.\n*   **Referrals:** If a civil surgeon refers an applicant for a specific evaluation, the referring physician must complete their section, and the civil surgeon must review the report before signing.\n*   **Burden of Proof:** The applicant must demonstrate admissibility by submitting a properly completed and valid Form I-693, indicating no Class A medical conditions and compliance with vaccination requirements, or a granted waiver.\n\nUSCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) for deficiencies or tampering with the form. Responses to RFEs can involve annotating the original form, completing a new form, or submitting specific sections of a new form.\n\nRecent updates to this chapter include policy changes regarding the validity of Form I-693, the transition from \"noncitizen\" to \"alien\" terminology, and incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content.

These designations apply to medical examinations conducted within the U.S. For applicants abroad, additional categories of communicable diseases subject to quarantine or posing a public health emergency of international concern may also apply. Notably, as of January 4, 2010, HIV infection is no longer considered a communicable disease of public health significance for immigration purposes.\n\nThe Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, requires civil surgeons to document findings related to these communicable diseases. Specific protocols are detailed for Tuberculosis screening, including age-related testing requirements, the necessity of follow-up tests like chest X-rays and sputum testing for positive results, and procedures for pregnant applicants. Similar testing requirements, based on age and other CDC factors, are outlined for Syphilis and Gonorrhea, with civil surgeons directed to consult the CDC's Technical Instructions.

      "summary": "Chapter 7 of the provided text outlines the grounds for inadmissibility related to physical or mental disorders with associated harmful behavior. This inadmissibility applies if an applicant has a current disorder with harmful behavior, or a past disorder with behavior likely to recur or lead to other harmful actions. Both a disorder and harmful behavior must be present; neither alone is sufficient. Harmful behavior is defined as a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of the applicant or others. Physical disorders are defined by the WHO's ICD, and mental disorders by the APA's DSM, with authoritative sources also considered. Substance abuse/addiction for non-controlled substances, when linked to harmful behavior, is classified as a mental disorder.\n\nAlcohol use disorders are treated as physical or mental disorders. Inadmissibility due to alcohol use disorder requires current or past harmful behavior (like DUI/DWI) that poses or is likely to pose a threat. A history of alcohol-related driving arrests/convictions can serve as evidence of such a disorder and harmful behavior. If an applicant's criminal history reveals significant alcohol-related driving incidents that were not addressed in the original medical exam, a re-examination focused on mental status may be required. A \"significant\" criminal record includes specific criteria like driving with a suspended license, causing injury/death, felony convictions, or multiple recent incidents.\n\nThe determination of inadmissibility rests on the civil surgeon's assessment during the re-examination. If a Class A condition is certified, the applicant is inadmissible, and may seek a waiver. This guidance also extends to other scenarios where evidence suggests a disorder with harmful behavior that the civil surgeon didn't consider, such as prior findings of inadmissibility, institutionalization, or other criminal history where substances were a factor. Civil surgeons must document findings on Form I-693.\n\nThe chapter also lists resources, appendices (none available), and updates concerning terminology changes and policy manual integration.",

      "summary": "Chapter 9 of the USCIS Policy Manual outlines the vaccination requirements for immigrants. Federal law mandates specific vaccines (mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, Haemophilus influenza type B, and Hepatitis B), while the CDC requires additional vaccines for public health reasons (Varicella, Influenza, Pneumococcal pneumonia, Rotavirus, Hepatitis A, and Meningococcal). Failure to obtain age and medically appropriate vaccines can lead to inadmissibility.\n\nBlanket waivers are available if a vaccine is deemed \"not medically appropriate\" due to age, medical contraindication (like a severe allergic reaction or pregnancy), insufficient time to complete a series, or if it's outside flu season. Civil surgeons document these reasons on Form I-693, and USCIS generally accepts these findings unless clearly erroneous. Pregnancy and immuno-compromised conditions are specifically addressed as contraindications, and waivers granted for these reasons at the time of examination are generally accepted even if the condition resolves later.\n\nBlanket waivers can also be granted in cases of nationwide vaccination shortages, but only if declared by the CDC and USCIS. For vaccinations administered abroad, \"not routinely available\" is accepted instead of a shortage.\n\nAdjudication involves verifying age-appropriate vaccinations were received or marked as \"not medically appropriate.\" If missing vaccines are no longer required at the adjudication date (e.g., applicant aged out), requirements are met. Otherwise, a Request for Evidence (RFE) is issued.\n\nSpecial considerations include the removal of the COVID-19 vaccination requirement (effective January 20, 2025) and the prior requirements for HPV and zoster vaccines, which are no longer mandated. Influenza vaccination is seasonal and requires specific conditions for RFEs if missed. Vaccines not required before August 1, 2008, are listed.\n\nCivil surgeons must correctly mark the results section of the vaccination assessment, indicating whether requirements are met, if blanket waivers are applicable, if individual waivers for religious/moral objections are sought, or if requirements are not met. Officers should review the assessment independently, as civil surgeons may misunderstand the boxes. Individual waivers for religious or moral convictions require Form I-601.\n\nAn exception to vaccination requirements exists for certain adopted children under 10 years old who meet specific orphan or Hague Convention adoptee classifications, provided parents sign an affidavit to ensure vaccination within 30 days of admission to the U.S. This exception does not apply if adoptive parents have religious or moral objections, in which case a waiver is needed.\n\nUpdates to this chapter have removed the COVID-19 vaccination requirement and made other technical changes, including replacing \"noncitizen\" with \"alien\" or other appropriate terms. Previous updates incorporated CDC guidance on COVID-19, and others involved revising guidance on communicable diseases and the validity period of Form I-693.",

This designation is specifically for completing vaccination assessments for refugees seeking adjustment of status. It simplifies the process for refugees and reduces USCIS's administrative burden. Participation is voluntary, and health departments must ensure their physicians meet professional qualifications. While nurses or other medical professionals can perform the assessment, a qualified health department physician must review and certify the Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693). These designated departments are exempt from application and fee requirements but must be familiar with the CDC's Technical Instructions. The designation is strictly for the vaccination component for refugees adjusting status; other medical exam components or adjustments for asylees require standard civil surgeon designation. For recording and certification, the Form I-693 must include the applicant's information, completed vaccination record, and the attending physician's signature (a stamp is acceptable) along with the health department's official seal or stamp.\n\n**Military Physicians:**\nUSCIS, in consultation with the CDC, also provides a blanket civil surgeon designation for military physicians. This allows them to complete all parts of the immigration medical examination for U.S. armed forces members and veterans, and certain dependents, who receive care at military treatment facilities (MTFs). This designation was extended to include certain Afghan nationals seeking special immigrant visas. The goal is to recognize military service and ease the examination process for these individuals. Eligible military physicians must meet professional qualifications, be employed by the Department of Defense or provide services to military members/veterans, and be authorized to practice at an MTF. They are exempt from USCIS application and fee requirements but must be familiar with the CDC's Technical Instructions. This designation is specifically for examinations conducted in the U.S. at an MTF (or other authorized location for Afghan nationals) for U.S. armed forces members/veterans and their eligible dependents, or for certain Afghan nationals. For other cases or preferences, a standard civil surgeon designation is required. Similar to health departments, military physicians must sign Form I-693, with nurses or other professionals co-signing optionally.

If they wish to be redesignated as a civil surgeon in the future, they must reapply.\n\n**Revocation:** While current regulations don't explicitly detail revocation procedures, USCIS can revoke a designation if a physician is no longer qualified. Grounds for revocation include:\n*   Consistently or intentionally failing to comply with Technical Instructions or Form I-693 Instructions, or other duties.\n*   Falsifying information or documents in the application for designation or on Form I-693.\n*   Failing to maintain a valid and unrestricted medical license in states where they conduct immigration medical exams.\n*   Being subject to disciplinary action that restricts their practice.\n*   Failing to meet professional qualifications at any time during their designation, unless the eligibility gap is corrected and they ceased examinations during the period of ineligibility.\n\n**Initiating Revocation:** USCIS must have well-documented evidence before initiating revocation. This may involve sworn statements from applicants, other available evidence, and potentially assistance from other USCIS offices or the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS). The case can be referred to USCIS counsel for review, who will be provided with the reasons for revocation and supporting evidence. A notice of intent to revoke will be served to the physician, outlining the grounds and evidence, and giving them 30 days to respond.\n\n**Malpractice and Ethics Complaints:** USCIS does not adjudicate complaints of malpractice or breaches of medical ethics. Such complaints should be directed to the relevant State medical licensing authority.\n\n**Decision:** After the physician's response period, USCIS will review the case and issue a written decision. There is no administrative appeal from a revocation decision, but a motion to reopen or reconsider can be filed.

      "summary": "This document, \"Chapter 3 - Immigrant Membership in Totalitarian Party,\" outlines the legal framework and adjudication process for determining immigrant inadmissibility based on membership in or affiliation with the Communist or any other totalitarian party in the United States.\n\nThe inadmissibility ground, codified in INA 212(a)(3)(D), aims to protect U.S. security against subversive activities. Historically, this law evolved from concerns during and after World War I and II, leading to various acts like the Immigration Act of 1918, the Alien Registration Act of 1940, and the Internal Security Act of 1950, culminating in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952.\n\nThe document details the process for determining inadmissibility, which involves:\n1.  Identifying the organization as a Communist or totalitarian party.\n2.  Establishing the applicant's membership or affiliation with such an organization.\n3.  Determining if this involvement was \"meaningful.\"\n4.  Assessing if any statutory exceptions apply.\n\n\"Communist Party\" is broadly defined to include various iterations of the party and related organizations. \"Totalitarian party\" is defined as an organization advocating for a totalitarian dictatorship in the U.S., characterized by a single, dictatorial political party indistinguishable from the government and the forcible suppression of opposition.\n\nMembership can be proven through testimony, membership cards, dues, or official records. Affiliation is broader and involves providing support or anything of value to the organization. Special considerations are given to military and government service, which do not automatically constitute membership but require scrutiny for inherent political nature.\n\nCrucially, for inadmissibility to be found, the membership or affiliation must be \"meaningful,\" meaning the applicant was aware of the political aspects of the organization. The burden of proof rests on the applicant to demonstrate admissibility.\n\nTwo primary statutory exceptions exist:\n1.  **Involuntary Membership:** This covers membership that was involuntary, occurred solely before age 16, was by operation of law, or was necessary to obtain essential living needs.\n2.  **Past Membership:** This applies if membership or affiliation terminated at least two or five years prior to the application date, and the applicant is not a threat to U.S. security.\n\nA discretionary waiver is available for certain family members of U.S. citizens or LPRs, provided the alien is not a security threat and warrants favorable discretion.\n\nThe document also lists relevant legal authorities, resources, and recent updates to the Policy Manual regarding terminology.",

Bonds are of unlimited duration and remain in effect until replaced, canceled, or breached.\n*   **Bond Stages:** The process involves posting, acceptance, maintenance, potential substitution, breach, and cancellation of the bond.\n*   **Updates and Revisions:** The document references several updates and rule changes, notably the 2022 Final Rule, and highlights the fluctuating legal landscape regarding public charge rules due to litigation.\n\nIn essence, public charge bonds serve as a financial guarantee against an individual becoming a burden on public resources, allowing for discretionary admission under specific circumstances.",

Alterations to the form or using a different contract will result in rejection.\n*   **Acceptance and Receipt:** If accepted, the bond is signed by a designated USCIS authority, and a receipt is issued to the obligor, alien, and their representatives. Acceptance allows the adjustment of status application adjudication to proceed.\n*   **Rejection:** If the bond does not meet requirements, it will not be accepted, and the adjustment of status application will be denied with an explanation of the deficiencies.\n\nThe document also includes extensive lists of related resources, appendices, and updates, reflecting ongoing policy and legal developments concerning public charge inadmissibility.",

It explains the purpose of these regulations, which is to allow governments to verify identities for border control. Historically, the 1924 Immigration Act criminalized visa fraud, a principle later codified in the INA. Amendments in 1986 expanded this to cover any immigration benefit, not just entry or documents, and in 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) established two distinct grounds: fraud/misrepresentation in obtaining benefits and false claims to U.S. citizenship made on or after September 30, 1996. This guidance specifically addresses the fraud and misrepresentation ground, including false claims made before that date. Key legal authorities cited include INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) and INA 212(i).

It defines both terms, outlining the elements required for an inadmissibility finding for each. Willful misrepresentation requires an alien to have procured or sought to procure a U.S. immigration benefit through a willfully made, material false representation to a U.S. government official. Fraud includes all elements of willful misrepresentation but additionally requires the alien to have intended to deceive the official and for the official to have believed and acted upon the false representation. The document emphasizes that fraud findings encompass willful misrepresentation findings, meaning an alien found inadmissible for fraud is also inadmissible for willful misrepresentation, but not vice-versa. It also details a step-by-step process for officers to determine inadmissibility for these grounds, noting the severe penalty of a lifetime bar from admission unless a waiver is granted.

      "summary": "Chapter 3 of the USCIS Policy Manual, titled \"Adjudicating Inadmissibility,\" details the grounds for inadmissibility related to fraud and willful misrepresentation.\n\n**Key points include:**\n\n*   **Evidence and Burden of Proof:** To establish inadmissibility for fraud or willful misrepresentation, there must be evidence that an alien used fraud or willfully misrepresented a material fact to obtain an immigration benefit from a U.S. government official. The burden of proof for admissibility always rests with the applicant. If evidence suggests potential inadmissibility, the applicant must rebut the finding.\n*   **Procuring a Benefit:** This inadmissibility applies when an alien seeks to procure, has sought to procure, or has procured an immigrant/nonimmigrant visa, other documentation, admission to the U.S., or another benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n*   **False Representation:** This involves making an assertion not in accordance with the true facts, either orally, in writing, or through submitted evidence. The misrepresentation must be connected to the alien's own immigration benefit.\n*   **Willfulness:** The misrepresentation must be made \"knowingly,\" not accidentally or in good faith. This requires the alien to have knowledge of the falsity and intentionally present false material facts. Silence or failure to volunteer information can be considered willful misrepresentation if it's a conscious concealment of known information.\n*   **Materiality:** A misrepresentation is material if it has a tendency to influence or is capable of influencing the decision-making body. This includes situations where the true facts would render the alien inadmissible or where the misrepresentation prevents relevant lines of inquiry. A \"harmless misrepresentation\" is not material and does not render an alien inadmissible, though it may be considered in discretionary decisions. Misrepresenting identity is generally material.\n*   **Made to a U.S. Government Official:** The fraud or willful misrepresentation must be made to a U.S. government official, not a private party.\n*   **Elements of Fraud:** In addition to the elements of willful misrepresentation, fraud requires the intent to deceive a U.S. government official and that the official believed and acted upon the misrepresentation. The distinction between fraud and willful misrepresentation is not always critical, as either can lead to inadmissibility.\n*   **Timely Retraction:** An alien can defend against inadmissibility by showing a timely and voluntary retraction of the false statement before being exposed or before the conclusion of the proceeding.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources, appendices, and a history of updates and technical changes to the policy manual.",

      "summary": "Chapter 2 of the USCIS Policy Manual details the grounds for inadmissibility based on a false claim to U.S. citizenship. An alien is inadmissible if they made a false representation of U.S. citizenship for any purpose or benefit under U.S. immigration or other federal/state laws. This does not require intent or knowledge of the falsity.\n\nThere are statutory exemptions for special immigrant juveniles and applicants for registry. A narrow exception exists for claims made on or after September 30, 1996, by those who reasonably believed they were U.S. citizens. No waivers are generally available for this ground, except for certain adjustment of status applicants.\n\nThe determination process involves several steps:\n1.  **False Claim:** Confirming if a false claim of U.S. citizenship was made. This can be oral, written, or through submitted evidence, and doesn't require an oath or a representation to a government official. It does not apply to a claim of U.S. national status if citizenship was not claimed.\n2.  **Date of Claim:** Determining if the claim was made on or after September 30, 1996. Claims before this date may fall under fraud or willful misrepresentation.\n3.  **Purpose or Benefit:** Ascertaining if the claim was for any purpose or benefit under the INA or other laws. This requires evidence of subjective intent to achieve a purpose/benefit where citizenship is relevant, and objective evidence that citizenship affected the outcome. Benefits can include passports, driver's licenses, employment, and avoiding negative legal consequences like removal or prohibitions on unauthorized employment. The claim must be for the alien's own purpose.\n4.  **Timely Retraction:** Assessing if the alien timely retracted the false claim before it was challenged or the proceeding concluded.\n\nRecent updates highlight that a false claim to U.S. citizenship does not always need to be material to result in inadmissibility, particularly in the Eleventh Circuit. The guidance also clarifies that knowledge, age, or mental capacity at the time of the claim do not negate inadmissibility, superseding prior interpretations.",

      "summary": "Chapter 3 of the USCIS Policy Manual, titled \"Adjudication,\" specifically addresses the ground of inadmissibility for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship. To establish this inadmissibility, evidence must show that an alien made a false representation of U.S. citizenship, in person, in writing, or otherwise, for any purpose or benefit under U.S. immigration law, federal law, or state law. The standard of proof requires sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that the claim was false.\n\nThe burden of proof for admissibility rests solely on the applicant and never shifts to the government. If there is no evidence of a false misrepresentation, the applicant meets their burden. Conversely, if evidence supports a reasonable conclusion of a false misrepresentation, the applicant has not met their burden and is inadmissible unless they can successfully rebut the finding.\n\nTo rebut a finding of inadmissibility, the applicant must prove \"clearly and beyond doubt\" that:\n1. The representation was not false.\n2. The false representation was not of U.S. citizenship.\n3. The false representation was made before September 30, 1996.\n4. The false representation was not for a purpose or benefit under relevant law.\n\nIf any of these points are established, the inadmissibility finding is rebutted. If none are established, the applicant remains inadmissible. In cases of equal weight of evidence, the applicant is considered inadmissible.\n\nFalsely claiming U.S. citizenship can also lead to a civil penalty or criminal conviction, though these are not prerequisites for an inadmissibility finding. A conviction or a civil penalty specifically for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship is sufficient proof of inadmissibility. However, a civil penalty for other types of document fraud does not automatically establish inadmissibility for falsely claiming citizenship.\n\nThe chapter also lists relevant resources, including sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), USCIS forms, and guidance on using the USCIS Policy Manual website.

      "summary": "Chapter 6 of the USCIS Policy Manual, titled \"Validity of an Approved Waiver,\" outlines the scope and duration of waivers of inadmissibility. Generally, a waiver is valid only for the specific grounds of inadmissibility and for the crimes, events, or conditions stated in the application. If an individual is found inadmissible for a new reason, a separate waiver is required.\n\nThe length of a waiver's validity is tied to the underlying immigration benefit it supports. For nonimmigrants, it's typically temporary and adjudicated by CBP, not carrying over to other benefit categories. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders receive waivers valid only for the duration of their TPS. Refugees granted a waiver for admission can use it for adjustment of status as a refugee without refiling, unless it's a medical waiver for a Class A condition, which may require a new waiver upon adjustment of status after a subsequent medical examination.\n\nCrucially, a waiver granted in connection with an application for Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status permanently waives the ground of inadmissibility for all future immigration benefits, even if LPR status is later abandoned. This permanence also applies to conditional permanent residents once conditions are removed, and to K-1/K-2 nonimmigrants who marry the petitioner, with the waiver remaining valid even if they don't adjust status or later lose LPR status. However, for certain criminal waivers or waivers of fraud/misrepresentation for conditional residents, the waiver automatically ends if conditional residency is terminated, unless an immigration judge overturns the termination. K-1/K-2 nonimmigrants who do not marry the petitioner remain inadmissible for benefits beyond the proposed marriage. For inter-country convention adoptees, the waiver is contingent on visa issuance and final approval of the adoption petition; denial of either voids the waiver.\n\nThe chapter also lists relevant resources, including USCIS regulations and forms, and notes recent technical updates concerning terminology changes (\"noncitizen\" vs. \"alien\" vs. \"foreign national\") and the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

      "summary": "Chapter 4, \"Qualifying Relative,\" of the USCIS Policy Manual outlines the criteria and procedures for establishing extreme hardship to a qualifying relative in the context of immigration waivers.\n\nKey aspects covered include:\n\n*   **Establishing the Relationship:** USCIS officers must verify the relationship between the applicant and the qualifying relative. This can be done through an approved Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) or by submitting primary evidence like birth or marriage certificates. If primary evidence is unavailable, secondary evidence or sworn testimony may be accepted.\n\n*   **Separation or Relocation:** Extreme hardship can arise from either the separation of the qualifying relative from the applicant (who is denied admission) or the qualifying relative's relocation overseas with the applicant. The focus is on the hardship that exceeds the common consequences of family separation or relocation. A credible statement from the qualifying relative detailing their intent to separate or relocate is crucial, though USCIS may request further evidence if the statement lacks plausibility.\n\n*   **Effect of Qualifying Relative's Death:** Generally, hardship to a deceased qualifying relative cannot be used to establish extreme hardship. However, an exception exists under INA 204(l), which allows for the approval of certain petitions and related applications even if the petitioner or principal beneficiary has died, provided specific requirements are met. In such cases, the death itself can be treated as the functional equivalent of extreme hardship.\n\n*   **Hardship to Non-Qualifying Relatives:** Hardship experienced by individuals who are not qualifying relatives (e.g., the applicant themselves, or other family members not specified in the waiver provision) cannot, on its own, satisfy the extreme hardship requirement. However, this hardship can be considered if it directly impacts a qualifying relative, affecting their emotional or financial well-being.\n\n*   **Aggregating Hardships:** To establish extreme hardship, it is not necessary for a single hardship factor to be extreme. All relevant hardship factors must be considered collectively. If the combined hardships to one or more qualifying relatives, even if individually not extreme, rise to the level of extreme hardship when aggregated, the standard is met. This also applies if multiple qualifying relatives would suffer hardship, and the cumulative effect meets the threshold.\n\nThe chapter also includes a list of relevant resources, such as USCIS forms and statutory provisions, and notes recent technical updates to the Policy Manual regarding terminology.",

      "summary": "This document, Chapter 5 of Volume 9 of the USCIS Policy Manual, provides guidance on determining \"extreme hardship\" to a qualifying relative when considering an applicant's inadmissibility waiver request. Key points include:\n\n*   **Totality of Circumstances:** Determinations must be based on all submitted factors, arguments, and evidence, as well as relevant information not explicitly presented by the applicant (e.g., country conditions).\n*   **Common Consequences:** Factors like family separation, economic detriment, and difficulties readjusting to a new country are generally considered \"common consequences\" and do not, in themselves, constitute extreme hardship. However, the standard for extreme hardship is lower than \"exceptional and extremely unusual.\"\n*   **Cumulative Consideration:** Factors must be considered cumulatively. Common consequences, when combined with other factors, may result in extreme hardship.\n*   **Factors Supporting Extreme Hardship:** The document lists numerous factors across categories like family ties, social/cultural impact, economic impact, health conditions, and country conditions that may support a finding of extreme hardship.\n*   **Particularly Significant Factors:** Certain circumstances are highlighted as often weighing heavily in favor of extreme hardship findings, including:\n    *   Prior grant of special immigrant status, T nonimmigrant status, asylum, or refugee status to the qualifying relative from the country of relocation.\n    *   Disability of the qualifying relative or a dependent family member.\n    *   Military service of the qualifying relative.\n    *   Department of State (DOS) travel warnings recommending against travel to the country of relocation.\n    *   Substantial displacement of caregiving responsibilities for children.\n*   **Hypothetical Case Examples:** The document provides several scenarios illustrating how different combinations of factors can lead to or preclude a finding of extreme hardship.\n*   **Resources and Updates:** The chapter also includes relevant legal resources, forms, and information about policy updates.",

      "summary": "This document outlines the purpose, background, scope, legal authorities, forms, and CDC's role in adjudicating waivers for medical inadmissibility in the United States. USCIS balances public health with family unity and applicant needs when granting waivers, often requiring treatment for medical conditions. Medical examinations are standard for most immigration applicants to identify conditions that render them inadmissible. These examinations result in a report (Form I-693 or its predecessors) where civil surgeons or panel physicians certify the absence or presence of Class A (inadmissible) or Class B (potentially inadmissible) conditions. Historically, waivers for health-related grounds were limited, but legislative changes have expanded their availability, particularly for those with close family ties in the U.S. The scope of this guidance focuses on waivers for immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on family or employment-based petitions, excluding inadmissibility due to drug abuse or addiction. Various forms are used for different immigration benefits when applying for a medical waiver, with fees varying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviews waiver applications to ensure proper examination and identification of a U.S. healthcare provider for treatment, with their review carrying significant weight in USCIS's decision. The document also lists relevant legal authorities and resources, including specific sections of the INA and CFR, and various USCIS forms.

      "summary": "This document outlines the purpose, background, and scope of waivers for inadmissibility due to fraud or willful misrepresentation, primarily focusing on waivers available under INA 212(i).\n\n**Purpose of the Waiver:**\n*   To provide humanitarian relief and promote family unity.\n*   To ensure applicants merit favorable discretion based on positive factors outweighing negative ones.\n*   To allow applicants to overcome grounds of inadmissibility or removability.\n\n**Background and Changes:**\n*   Prior to September 30, 1996, waivers were available based on 10 years passing since the misrepresentation or extreme hardship to U.S. citizen/LPR family.\n*   The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) limited this, eliminating the 10-year provision and restricting hardship to U.S. citizen/LPR parents, spouses, fiancés(es), or for VAWA self-petitioners to their qualifying family members.\n*   IIRIRA created separate inadmissibility grounds for fraud/willful misrepresentation (INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i)) and falsely claiming U.S. citizenship on or after September 30, 1996 (INA 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)).\n*   The waiver discussed primarily applies to INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) and not to false claims to U.S. citizenship made after the IIRIRA effective date. However, claims made before this date are treated as fraud/willful misrepresentation.\n\n**Scope and Eligibility:**\nThe availability of the waiver depends on the immigration benefit sought. This guidance specifically addresses the INA 212(i) waiver for applicants seeking:\n*   Immigrant visas or adjustment of status based on family petitions or as VAWA self-petitioners.\n*   Immigrant visas or adjustment of status based on employment-based petitions.\n*   K visas (fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens and their children).\n*   V visas (spouses and children of LPRs).\n\nThe document also details specific waiver provisions and relevant forms (e.g., I-601, I-602, I-192, I-690) for various categories including immigrants, adjustment of status applicants, K and V visa applicants, refugees, asylees, legalization and SAW applicants, and nonimmigrants (including T and U visa applicants).\n\n**Legal Authorities:**\n*   INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) - Misrepresentation\n*   INA 212(i) - Waiver for fraud or willful misrepresentation\n\n**Updates:**\nThe document notes recent technical updates related to terminology changes (\"noncitizen\" to \"alien\" or other terms, and vice versa) and the incorporation of Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. It also highlights that USCIS is issuing specific guidance on fraud and willful misrepresentation grounds of inadmissibility and waivers.",

To be eligible for a waiver, an applicant must demonstrate that denial of admission would cause extreme hardship to a qualifying relative (or to themselves if a VAWA self-petitioner) and that granting the waiver is a favorable exercise of discretion. The adjudication involves three steps: identifying a qualifying relative (U.S. citizen/LPR parent or spouse, or K-1/K-2 fiancé(e) petitioner for K-1/K-2 applicants; VAWA self-petitioners do not need a qualifying relative), determining extreme hardship, and then analyzing whether discretion should be exercised favorably. The discretionary analysis weighs positive factors, such as extreme hardship and family unity, against negative factors, primarily the fraud or misrepresentation itself. The nature, circumstances, motivation, age, mental capacity, pattern of behavior, and context of the fraud are considered.",

Termination of conditional status also terminates the waiver.\n*   **Scope of Waiver:** A waiver only applies to the specific grounds and incidents detailed in the application. New incidents of fraud or misrepresentation require a new waiver application. USCIS can reconsider an approved waiver if an error is found.\n*   **K-1/K-2 Visa Applicants:** For fiancé(e) visa applicants, the waiver is conditional upon the K-1 nonimmigrant marrying the U.S. citizen petitioner. If the marriage does not occur, the applicant remains inadmissible for other immigration benefits.\n*   **Implicit Waiver for Documentary Requirements:** Granting a waiver for fraud or willful misrepresentation implicitly waives inadmissibility due to lack of documentary requirements at the time of entry, such as not possessing a valid visa.\n\nThe document also lists relevant resources, confirms no appendices are available, and details several technical updates and policy manual revisions.",

This includes certain security grounds, international child abduction, and former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation. The decision to grant an INA 212(d)(3) waiver is discretionary and involves balancing social and humanitarian factors against adverse ones, such as the risk of harm to society, seriousness of violations, and reasons for seeking entry.

To be eligible, applicants must be admissible to the U.S. or have any grounds of inadmissibility waived. Waivers previously granted for T nonimmigrant status are generally honored. If new grounds of inadmissibility arise or were not previously addressed, applicants may need to file Form I-601 and provide evidence.\n\nUSCIS can waive most grounds of inadmissibility for T nonimmigrant adjustment applicants under INA 245(l)(2), with exceptions for security-related grounds, international child abduction, and renunciation of citizenship to avoid taxation. For health-related inadmissibility, the waiver standard is whether it's in the national interest. For other grounds, the standard requires it to be in the national interest and for the inadmissible acts to be caused by or incident to the applicant's trafficking victimization. Unlawful presence can also be waived if it was a central reason for the victimization, and specific evidence is required. T nonimmigrants are statutorily exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, with an exception for those requiring an Affidavit of Support under Section 213A.\n\nThe waiver analysis for non-health-related grounds involves a three-step process: 1) establishing the link between the inadmissibility and the trafficking victimization, 2) demonstrating that waiving the ground is in the national interest, considering factors like cooperation with law enforcement and community contributions, and 3) a discretionary analysis weighing favorable and unfavorable factors.

      "summary": "The bona fide determination process, implemented by USCIS in June 2021, aims to expedite employment authorization and deferred action for victims of crimes seeking U nonimmigrant status. This process applies to Form I-918 petitions filed by individuals residing in the United States, both before and after June 14, 2021. USCIS adjudicates these cases in receipt date order, prioritizing older, non-waitlisted petitions.\n\nPrincipal petitioners are evaluated first, requiring a properly filed Form I-918 with a law enforcement certification, a personal statement, and cleared background checks, followed by a favorable discretionary assessment. Once a principal petitioner receives employment authorization, their qualifying family members' petitions are then evaluated. Family members must independently demonstrate their petition's bona fides, including having their own background checks cleared and a credible family relationship.\n\nApplicants do not need to take further action for USCIS to initiate a bona fide determination on pending petitions. If additional documentation is needed, USCIS will issue a notice. While filing Form I-765 with the initial petition is an option, it's not strictly required for the bona fide determination process itself. Fees are generally not charged for the initial Form I-765 associated with a bona fide determination EAD, but renewal fees will apply. Proof of economic necessity is not required for this determination.\n\nBona fide determination EADs and deferred action are initially valid for four years and can generally be renewed if the final U visa adjudication is not complete. However, USCIS can revoke these benefits if circumstances change, such as the withdrawal of a law enforcement certification or security concerns. The process also satisfies the prima facie standard for individuals in removal proceedings. Certifying officials' roles remain unchanged, as USCIS evaluates the law enforcement certification for initial eligibility and then for final adjudication.

A-Files may also contain petitions from relatives, AR-2 registration forms for pre-1944 arrivals, records of Enemy Alien status, reports of consolidated agency records, refugee legislation documents, address change postcards from the 1940s and 1950s, and for those naturalized after March 31, 1956, all naturalization documents including the Application to File a Petition for Naturalization. Since 2010, A-Files of immigrants born over 100 years ago are being transferred to the National Archives, though most remain with USCIS.

      "summary": "A-Files, or Alien Files, are individual immigration and naturalization records identified by a unique Alien Registration Number (A-Number). These files were officially established on April 1, 1944, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to consolidate all records for an individual alien, thereby streamlining record-keeping. Before A-Files, aliens often had multiple, separate files.\n\nA-Files numbered below 8 million specifically pertain to immigrants arriving between April 1, 1944, and May 1, 1951, reopened cases from the Alien Registration Program, or other law enforcement matters. However, if an immigrant naturalized before April 1, 1956, their records were consolidated into a Certificate File (C-File), and the A-File ceased to exist. After April 1, 1956, all active case records, including naturalization, were filed in the A-File.\n\nThese older A-Files are a valuable source of biographical information, containing documents like visas, photographs, applications, and correspondence. While the majority of A-Files are held by USCIS, over 350,000 older A-Files (for individuals born before 1909) have been transferred to the National Archives (NARA) and can be searched online.\n\nResearchers can request A-Files numbered below 8 million through a Genealogy Record Request. Requests for A-Files numbered 8 million and above must go through the USCIS Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Program. Retrieving these older, off-site files may take longer, and some information, particularly regarding third parties, may be redacted due to privacy restrictions. A-Numbers for deceased individuals with A-Files below 8 million can be obtained via an Index Search Request (Form G-1041).",

This program, mandated by the Alien Registration Act of 1940, required fingerprinting and registration of all aliens aged 14 and older as a national security measure during World War II. Over 5.6 million AR-2s were completed, each assigned a unique Alien Registration Number (A-Number). While most original AR-2s were destroyed, microfilm copies exist and are maintained by USCIS. These forms contain a wealth of information, including personal details, immigration history, occupation, and military service, making them valuable for tracing individuals' presence in the US during the early 1940s.

Signatures or marks from registrants (and witnesses if illiterate) and registration officials, along with postal service stamps, are also part of the record. The AR-2 form is particularly valuable for researching elderly immigrants in 1940, those with limited arrival records, or for uncovering earlier immigration or naturalization documents.

This act allowed individuals who entered the U.S. before July 1, 1924, and for whom no arrival record existed, to have one created. This was crucial because the Basic Naturalization Act of 1906 required proof of lawful entry for naturalization, a requirement many immigrants couldn't meet due to missing records. Registry Files often contain extensive biographical details about the immigrant, including their journey to the U.S. and their activities since arrival. These files can include applications, testimony, evidence, correspondence, photos, and decisions, and are arranged by Registry File Number (R-#####). For genealogists, these files are valuable resources, potentially containing school records, insurance receipts, rental agreements, and other documents establishing residence. However, searching for specific Registry Files can be challenging due to limited index information and the fact that some files may have been consolidated into A-Files or C-Files after 1944. Additionally, privacy restrictions may lead to redactions of personal information about third parties.

These files are highly valuable for genealogical research due to the inclusion of photographs, extensive biographical data, and attached vital records. The Immigration Act of 1924 mandated that all arriving aliens present a visa, which was obtained from U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad. Upon arrival, immigrant visas were sent to Washington D.C., assigned a unique Visa File number, and indexed by name, date, and place of birth. After April 1, 1944, new visas were filed in Alien Files (A-Files), and Visa Files were retired to storage in 1952. Today, these files, numbering over 3.1 million, are retrieved for naturalization, genealogical, and Freedom of Information Act requests. Researchers should note that some Visa Files may have been consolidated into A-Files or C-Files if cases were reopened after April 1, 1944. The files contain crucial information like the immigrant's name, birth details, parents' names, prior addresses, and vital records such as birth certificates, health certificates, and police certificates, with photographs being a key feature for researchers. It is important to distinguish between the Department of State (DOS) visa number found on passenger lists and the USCIS Visa File number, which is necessary for requesting files. Researchers must submit an Index Search Request (Form G-1041) to obtain a Visa File number, as these are not publicly available. Name variations and the original arrival name are crucial for successful searches, especially for immigrants who did not naturalize.

      "summary": "This document explains how U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determines if a new job offer is in the \"same or similar\" occupational classification for individuals with a pending Form I-485 to change employers or jobs, a process known as \"job portability\" under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act (AC21).\n\nKey points:\n*   **Job Portability:** Allows individuals with a pending Form I-485 (filed based on employment) that has been pending for 180 days or more to change jobs or employers without needing a new Form I-140, as long as the new job is in the same or similar occupational classification as the original job. This is requested using Form I-485, Supplement J.\n*   **Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System:** The Department of Labor (DOL) uses this system, organized by six-digit codes, to classify jobs. USCIS officers may refer to the SOC system, the Occupational Outlook Handbook, and the Occupational Employment Statistics Database.\n*   **Factors for Determination:** USCIS officers consider multiple factors, including the DOL's SOC system, job duties, required skills, experience, education, training, licenses/certifications, SOC codes from relevant forms (I-140, ETA Form 9089, I-485 Supplement J), wages, and other credible evidence.\n*   **Totality of Circumstances:** USCIS makes decisions based on the overall circumstances and a preponderance of the evidence, not just a simple numerical comparison of SOC codes.\n*   **No Simple Code Matching:** Matching digits in SOC codes does not automatically determine similarity. For example, stonemasons (47-2022) and boilermakers (47-2010) share the first four digits but have significantly different job descriptions.\n*   **Wage Considerations:** While wages are considered, USCIS doesn't rely solely on them. Factors like inflation, geographic location, economic sector, corporate changes, and employer type (for-profit vs. non-profit) are taken into account.\n*   **Case-by-Case Basis:** Eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis, assessing if the new position is primarily responsible for the same or similar functions as the original job.",

The online system offers guidance, helps avoid common errors, and allows for electronic evidence uploads. A paper application is also an option.\n\nThere is no filing fee for Form I-765 if you have a pending Form I-589 (asylum application) that has been pending for 150 days. For those with temporary residency authorization, there is a $410 fee, but fee waivers may be available.\n\nRequired evidence for Form I-765 includes proof of your arrival/status (like Form I-94), a copy of your current EAD (if applicable), government-issued ID if you don't have a previous EAD, and Form G-28 if represented by an attorney. Form I-94s can be obtained online from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nUSCIS will notify you of their decision in writing. If approved, your EAD will be mailed, or you may need to pick it up in person. It's crucial to update your address with USCIS if you move.",

      "summary": "This document outlines temporary and permanent pathways for non-U.S. citizens working in STEM fields in the United States, along with key considerations for STEM professionals.\n\n**Key Considerations for Choosing a STEM Pathway:**\n\n*   **Eligibility:** Pathways vary in their requirements for education, experience, and skills. Some, like O-1 and EB-1A, are for individuals with \"extraordinary ability,\" while others, like H-1B, require at least a bachelor's degree. L-1 visas require an existing relationship with a company operating both in the U.S. and abroad.\n*   **Job Offer Requirement:** Most pathways necessitate a job offer and require the employer to file the application. However, some categories, such as EB-1A for \"extraordinary ability\" green card applicants, allow for self-petitioning without a job offer.\n*   **Temporary vs. Permanent Status:**\n    *   **Immigrant (Permanent) Pathways:** Offer a path to permanent residency, allowing unlimited work in the U.S. and a potential route to citizenship.\n    *   **Non-Immigrant (Temporary) Pathways:** Allow temporary residence and work in the U.S. Many individuals on these pathways eventually transition to permanent residency.\n*   **Additional Criteria:** Some visas have specific requirements, such as the TN visa being exclusively for Canadian and Mexican citizens. Certain immigrant pathways also require employers to obtain labor certification from the Department of Labor, confirming no qualified U.S. workers are available.\n\n**Summary of U.S. STEM Employment Pathways:**\n\n**Non-Immigrant (Temporary) Pathways:**\n\n*   **F-1 OPT:** Post-graduation Optional Practical Training for F-1 students with STEM degrees. Offers up to 12 months, with a potential 24-month STEM OPT extension.\n*   **H-1B:** For \"specialty occupations\" requiring a U.S. bachelor's degree or equivalent. Typically allows up to six years, with potential extensions for those pursuing permanent residency. Subject to annual caps and often involves a lottery.\n*   **J-1:** For exchange visitors in STEM fields, requiring approval from a U.S. Department of State designated sponsor. Duration varies by program, typically up to five years.\n*   **O-1:** For individuals with extraordinary ability, demonstrating sustained national or international acclaim. No maximum stay limit, but requires evidence of continued work in the field.\n*   **L-1A:** For intracompany transferees in managerial or executive roles. Requires one year of overseas work for a qualifying company. Maximum seven years.\n*   **L-1B:** For intracompany transferees with specialized knowledge. Requires one year of overseas work. Maximum five years, with potential conversion to L-1A.\n*   **TN:** For Canadian and Mexican professionals in specific occupations listed under NAFTA/USMCA. Initial approval for three years, with unlimited three-year extensions.\n\n**Immigrant (Permanent) Pathways:**\n\n*   **EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability):** For individuals with sustained national or international acclaim. No job offer or labor certification needed, but requires proof of continued work in the field.\n*   **EB-1B (Outstanding Professors and Researchers):** For those with international recognition in an academic field. Requires a job offer but not labor certification.\n*   **EB-1C (Multinational Managers and Executives):** For those transferring from overseas to a managerial or executive role in the U.S. Requires a job offer but not labor certification.\n*   **EB-2 (Advanced Degree/Exceptional Ability, excluding NIW):** For professionals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability. Generally requires a job offer and labor certification.\n*   **EB-2 (National Interest Waiver - NIW):** For those with advanced degrees or exceptional ability whose work is of substantial national importance.

Previously obtained STEM degrees or future higher-level STEM degrees can also be used for extensions, provided the practical training is directly related to the STEM degree.\n\nTo apply, students must submit Form I-765 with the correct fee, employer's E-Verify information, an endorsed Form I-20, and a copy of their STEM degree. Applications can be submitted up to 90 days before the current OPT expires and within 60 days of the DSO's SEVIS recommendation. Pending applications automatically extend employment authorization for 180 days.\n\nStudents have reporting responsibilities, including notifying their Designated School Official (DSO) of changes in personal or employer information within 10 days and reporting to the DSO every six months to confirm information. Unemployment limitations apply: 90 days for initial OPT and an additional 60 days for the STEM OPT extension, totaling 150 days.\n\nEmployers must be enrolled in and in good standing with E-Verify, possess a valid EIN, and implement a formal training program. They must report material changes in student employment and student terminations within specified timeframes. Employers must also ensure a bona fide employer-employee relationship, not replace U.S. workers, and provide training aligned with the student's degree and goals. Staffing agencies and similar arrangements may face scrutiny to ensure a genuine employer-employee relationship. Employers attest to these responsibilities by completing Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT Students, which DHS may verify through site visits.",

      "summary": "Optional Practical Training (OPT) allows F-1 students to gain temporary employment experience directly related to their major field of study. Students can apply for up to 12 months of OPT, which can be used either before (pre-completion) or after (post-completion) completing their studies. Any pre-completion OPT used will reduce the available post-completion OPT time.\n\nPre-completion OPT can be undertaken after one full academic year of enrollment and allows for part-time work (20 hours/week) during the school year and full-time work during breaks. Post-completion OPT is for after graduation and requires at least part-time work.\n\nStudents with STEM degrees may be eligible for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT if employed by an E-Verify enrolled employer.\n\nTo apply for OPT, students must get a recommendation from their Designated School Official (DSO) who will update their SEVIS record and endorse their Form I-20. They then must file Form I-765 with USCIS, including the required fee and documentation. The timing for applying varies depending on whether it's for pre-completion, initial post-completion, or a STEM OPT extension, and whether the degree is STEM or non-STEM. Employment authorization begins only after USCIS approves the application and issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\n\nIf an F-1 student transfers to a new school or starts a new educational level, their OPT authorization automatically terminates. Working on a terminated EAD has serious consequences.\n\nF-1 students with approved H-1B petitions may be eligible for a \"cap-gap\" extension if their F-1 status and work authorization expire before their H-1B status begins on October 1st.",
