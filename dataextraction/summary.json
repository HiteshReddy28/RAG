        "summary": "This document outlines the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program for F-1 students, allowing temporary employment directly related to their major area of study.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **What is OPT?** Temporary employment directly related to an F-1 student's major.\n*   **Duration:** Up to 12 months of employment authorization, which can be used before (pre-completion) and/or after (post-completion) academic studies. Pre-completion OPT reduces available post-completion OPT time.\n\n**Types of OPT:**\n\n1.  **Pre-completion OPT:**\n    *   Eligible after one full academic year of full-time enrollment (F-1 status not strictly required for the full year).\n    *   Work limits: 20 hours/week while school is in session; full-time when school is not in session.\n    *   Impact on Post-completion: 1 year of part-time pre-completion OPT reduces post-completion OPT by 6 months; 1 year of full-time pre-completion OPT eliminates post-completion OPT eligibility at the same education level.\n2.  **Post-completion OPT:**\n    *   Eligible after completing studies.\n    *   Work limits: Must work at least part-time (20+ hours/week) or full-time.\n\n**STEM OPT Extension:**\n\n*   **Eligibility:** F-1 students with a degree in a qualifying Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field from the STEM Designated Degree Program List.\n*   **Conditions:** Must be employed by an E-Verify employer and have received an initial grant of post-completion OPT based on the STEM degree.\n*   **Duration:** Allows for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT.\n\n**Applying for OPT:**\n\n1.  **DSO Recommendation:** Request your Designated School Official (DSO) at your institution to recommend OPT by endorsing your Form I-20 and making a notation in SEVIS.\n2.  **USCIS Application:** File Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with USCIS, including the required fee and supporting documents.\n    *   **Alert:** Submitted photos must be unmounted and unretouched (not edited or digitally enhanced) to avoid processing delays.\n\n**When to Apply:**\n\n*   **Pre-completion OPT (STEM & Non-STEM):** After DSO enters recommendation into SEVIS; up to 90 days before completing a full academic year (employment can't start until full year is complete).\n*   **Initial Post-completion OPT (STEM & Non-STEM):** After DSO enters recommendation into SEVIS; *within 30 days* of DSO entry; up to 90 days before degree completion, but no later than 60 days after degree completion.\n*   **STEM OPT Extension:** After DSO enters recommendation into SEVIS; *within 60 days* of DSO entry; up to 90 days before current OPT employment authorization expires.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   You cannot begin OPT employment until your Form I-765 is approved and you receive your Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\n*   A timely filed STEM OPT extension application grants an automatic 180-day employment authorization extension if your current OPT expires while the application is pending.\n*   **Termination:** Transferring to a different school or beginning studies at a new educational level (e.g., Bachelor's to Master's) will automatically terminate your OPT employment authorization. Working on a terminated EAD can lead to serious consequences.\n*   **Cap-gap Extension:** F-1 students with a timely filed H-1B petition and change of status request may be eligible for a cap-gap extension if their F-1 status and employment authorization expire before the H-1B status begins (typically Oct. 1).",

        "summary": "The International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to grant temporary authorized stay (parole) to foreign entrepreneurs whose U.S. business ventures provide a significant public benefit. This parole enables entrepreneurs to work exclusively for their startup, with spouses potentially eligible for employment authorization and minor children eligible for parole.\n\n**Key Updates Effective October 1, 2024:**\nBy regulation, investment and revenue amounts are automatically adjusted every three years by the Consumer Price Index. The new amounts, effective for applications filed on or after October 1, 2024, are:\n*   **Qualified Investment (from a qualifying investor):** Increasing from $264,147 to **$311,071**.\n*   **Qualified Government Award/Grant:** Increasing from $105,659 to **$124,429**.\n*   **Revenue for Re-parole Consideration:** Increasing from $528,293 to **$622,142**.\n*   **Qualifying Investor Criteria:** Must have invested at least **$746,571** (up from $633,952) in startups over 5 years, with at least two of those startups creating 5 jobs or generating **$622,142** (up from $528,293) in revenue with 20% annualized growth.\n\n**Eligibility Requirements:**\n*   **Entrepreneur:** Must hold at least 10% ownership (5% for re-parole) in the startup and have a central, active role. Must be well-positioned due to knowledge, skills, or experience to assist the business's growth.\n*   **Startup Entity:**\n    *   Must be a U.S. business formed within the past 5 years.\n    *   Must demonstrate substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation. This can be shown by receiving:\n        *   At least **$311,071** in qualified investments from qualifying investors within the past 18 months; **OR**\n        *   At least **$124,429** in qualified government awards or grants within the past 18 months; **OR**\n        *   Alternative reliable and compelling evidence if partially meeting funding thresholds.\n*   **Qualified Investor:** A U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or a U.S.-based organization majority-owned/controlled by such, with a proven track record of investing in successful startups (as per updated criteria above). Not the entrepreneur or immediate relatives.\n*   **Qualified Investment:** Purchase of equity, convertible debt, or other equity-convertible security. Bank or personal loans not convertible to equity do not count.\n*   **Qualified Government Award/Grant:** Awards for economic development, R&D, or job creation from U.S. federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide such grants to startups. Excludes foreign government awards and contractual commitments for goods/services.\n\n**Application Process:**\n*   **Entrepreneur:** Files Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole, with the required fee and supporting documents. Initial parole is for up to 2.5 years, with a possible re-parole for another 2.5 years (maximum 5 years). Up to 3 entrepreneurs per startup may be eligible.\n*   **Spouse and Children:** May file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, concurrently with Form I-941 or separately, to request parole to accompany or join the entrepreneur. Spouses can apply for employment authorization (Form I-765, Eligibility Category (C)(34)) *after* being paroled into the U.S. Children are not eligible for employment authorization.\n*   **Biometrics:** All applicants (entrepreneur, spouse, children) must submit biometrics (fingerprints and photograph). This occurs at a USCIS Application Support Center if electing to receive documents at a U.S. address, or at a U.S. embassy/consulate abroad if applying from overseas.\n*   **Travel and Parole:**\n    *   If applying from *inside* the U.S. and conditionally approved, the entrepreneur will receive a Form I-512L Advance Parole document but must *depart* the U.S. to be paroled back in by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a port of entry.\n    *   If applying from *outside* the U.S. (or electing overseas processing), a conditional approval leads to processing at a U.S. embassy/consulate for biometrics and travel documentation (e.g., boarding foil) before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for CBP's final parole determination.\n    *   Canadian nationals traveling directly from Canada can present an approved/conditionally approved Form I-941 at a port of entry without prior travel documentation.\n    *   Parole allows for multiple entries within its validity period.\n*   **Status Changes:** Parole is not admission. While a parolee can apply for immigrant or nonimmigrant status, they generally cannot adjust or change status within the U.S. and may need to leave the country for visa processing.\n\n**Filing Addresses (USCIS Dallas Lockbox):**\n*   **For USPS:**\n    USCIS\n    Attn: IER\n    PO Box 650890\n    Dallas, TX 75265\n*   **For FedEx, UPS, and DHL:**\n    USCIS\n    Attn: IER (Box 650890)\n    2501 S. State Highway 121 Business\n    Suite 400\n    Lewisville, TX 75067\n\n**Processing Time:** USCIS aims to adjudicate new applications expeditiously. Premium processing is not available for Form I-941, but expedite requests can be made. USCIS coordinates with the Department of State to ensure timely processing for those applying from abroad.\n\nFor detailed information, applicants should consult the Federal Register notice, USCIS Policy Manual, Form I-941 page, and 8 CFR section 212.19.",

(Note: This is specific to the STEM OPT extension and not the broader 8 CFR 274a.13(d) rule).\n\n4.  **Student Reporting Responsibilities (to DSO):**\n    *   Report changes to legal name, residential/mailing address, email, employer's name, and employer's address within 10 days of the change.\n    *   Confirm the above information every 6 months, even if no changes occurred.\n\n5.  **Unemployment Limits:**\n    *   Initial post-completion OPT: Up to 90 days total.\n    *   24-month STEM OPT extension: An additional 60 days (for a total of 150 days during the entire OPT period).\n\n6.  **Employer Responsibilities:**\n    *   Be enrolled in E-Verify (valid Company ID or Client Company ID) and remain in good standing.\n    *   Have a valid IRS Employer Identification Number (EIN).\n    *   Report material changes to the student's employment (via modified Form I-983) to the DSO at the earliest opportunity.\n    *   Report termination of employment or student's departure to the DSO within 5 business days.\n    *   Implement a formal training program that builds on the student's academic learning.\n    *   Provide an OPT opportunity with duties, hours, and compensation commensurate with similarly situated U.S. workers.\n\n7.  **Terms and Conditions for Employer Participation:**\n    *   Must maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student.\n    *   Must have sufficient resources and personnel to provide appropriate training as specified in Form I-983 (Training Plan for STEM OPT Students).\n    *   The STEM OPT student must *not* replace a U.S. worker (full-time, part-time, temporary, or permanent).\n    *   The training must assist the student in achieving their training goals.\n    *   DHS may conduct site visits to verify compliance.\n    *   **Training Obligation:** Training plans must be customized for the individual student, directly relating the OPT opportunity to their STEM degree and learning objectives. Employers cannot delegate training responsibilities to third parties (e.g., clients/customers). Supervisors can be employer's employees or direct contractors, but not client employees or other F-1 OPT/STEM OPT students.\n    *   **Staffing/Temporary Agencies:** These firms may employ STEM OPT students only if they are the entity providing the practical training and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship. Arrangements like multiple employers, sole proprietorships, or consulting firms providing labor for hire may face scrutiny regarding the bona fide employer-employee relationship.\n\n**Important Note:** Photos submitted to USCIS must be unmounted and unretouched; edited or digitally enhanced photos will delay processing.",

For example, a tourist wanting to become a student must apply. It's recommended to apply as soon as you decide to change status. Do not change your activity until USCIS approves the change, as failure to maintain your current status can lead to bars from re-entry or deportation.

On-Campus Employment (F-1 Students):**\n*   **Conditions:** Requires Designated School Official (DSO) approval.\n*   **Hours:** Up to 20 hours per week when school is in session; full-time during vacation periods.\n*   **Location:** On-campus, or off-campus locations educationally affiliated with the school if the employment is an integral part of the student's educational program.\n*   **Employer:** The school itself or independent companies serving the school (e.g., bookstore, cafeteria).\n*   **Restrictions:** Must not displace U.S. residents. Employment cannot begin more than 30 days before classes start.\n*   **Authorization:** F-1 students in on-campus employment do not need to apply for employment authorization with USCIS.\n\n**B. Off-Campus Employment (F-1 Students):**\n*   **General Conditions:** USCIS may authorize part-time off-campus employment after an F-1 student has maintained status for one full academic year and is in good academic standing (as determined by the DSO).\n*   **1. Severe Economic Hardship:**\n    *   **Eligibility:** USCIS may authorize off-campus employment if on-campus opportunities are unavailable/insufficient, or due to severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond the student's control. Examples include loss of financial aid, currency fluctuations, increased tuition, or unexpected medical bills.\n    *   **Process:** The DSO must recommend the student on Form I-20. The student must then file Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization) and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD, Form I-766) from USCIS before starting work.\n    *   **Validity:** EADs are granted in 1-year intervals, not extending past the program completion date, and are renewable. Authorization terminates upon school transfer or when the need ceases (not for a new program at the same school).\n*   **2. Severe Economic Hardship due to Emergent Circumstances (Special Student Relief - SSR):**\n    *   **Trigger:** DHS may suspend certain regulatory requirements for F-1 students from specific regions experiencing severe economic hardship due to emergent circumstances (e.g., natural disasters, financial crises, military conflicts), announced via a Federal Register notice.\n    *   **Impact:** Can suspend full course of study and employment requirements.\n    *   **Lawful Status:** Students maintain lawful status by registering for at least the minimum course load specified in the Federal Register notice (e.g., 6 semester/quarter hours for undergraduate, 3 for graduate) and making normal progress.\n    *   **Eligibility:** Student must be a citizen of the specified country, lawfully present in F-1 status on the notice publication date, enrolled in a SEVP-certified school, maintaining F-1 status, and experiencing severe economic hardship directly from the emergent circumstances. DSO certifies eligibility in SEVIS and on Form I-20.\n\n**C. Documentation:**\n*   **On-Campus Employment:** For general on-campus work, no Form I-765 is needed. For full-time on-campus work under SSR, the DSO must note it on Form I-20, based on demonstrated severe economic hardship.\n*   **Off-Campus Employment:** Requires filing Form I-765 with a properly endorsed Form I-20 and receiving an EAD from USCIS before commencing employment. For full-time off-campus work under SSR, the DSO must note it on Form I-20, based on demonstrated severe economic hardship.\n*   **SSR EAD Validity:** Typically up to 1 year, unless the 1-year limitation is suspended by a Federal Register notice, allowing authorization for the notice's validity period (not exceeding the student's program end date).\n*   **Existing Employment Authorization:** F-1 students with existing off-campus authorization may benefit from SSR without a new EAD by having their DSO update their Form I-20. Similarly, for on-campus employment under SSR allowing reduced course load, the DSO must update Form I-20.\n\n**D. F-1 Student Sponsored by an International Organization:**\n*   **Process:** An F-1 student offered employment by a recognized international organization must apply for employment authorization with USCIS.\n*   **Documentation:** Requires a written certification from the organization, a Form I-20 with the employment page completed by the DSO, and a completed Form I-765 with the required fee. An EAD must be received before starting employment.\n\n**M-1 Practical Training:**\n*   M-1 students may engage in practical training only after completing their course of study, provided it is related to their study and comparable employment is unavailable in their home country. This requires USCIS approval and an EAD.",

Relevant 8 CFR regulations cover student eligibility, school approval, SEVIS fees, and employment authorization.\n*   **F-1 vs. M-1 Requirements (Appendices Summary):**\n    *   Both require enrollment at an SEVP-certified school, full-time study as bona fide students, and sufficient funds (M-1 needs *immediately available* funds for the entire stay).\n    *   **Public Schools:** F-1 is allowed in public high schools (9-12) for a max of 12 months with paid unsubsidized cost; not for K-8. M-1 is not permitted in public K-8.\n    *   **School Transfers:** F-1 is generally allowed; M-1 requires USCIS authorization, typically early in the program and for reasons beyond the student's control, without changing educational objective.\n    *   **Practical Training:** F-1 allows Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Optional Practical Training (OPT) (pre/post-completion), and STEM OPT Extension, all requiring specific authorizations and USCIS approval. M-1 allows practical training *only after* course completion, related to the study, and if comparable employment is unavailable in the home country, requiring USCIS approval.\n    *   **Maximum Stay:** F-1 is for the duration of status; M-1 is limited to 1 year, with extensions not exceeding 3 years cumulative.\n    *   **Family Members:** Spouses and unmarried children under 21 are eligible for F-2 and M-2 visas, respectively.\n*   **Updates:** Recent updates include terminology changes (e.g., \"noncitizen\" vs. \"alien\"), new policy guidance for F/M classifications, alignment with the 2020 Fee Schedule Final Rule, and the integration of Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual.",

        "summary": "This document outlines the eligibility requirements for F-1 (academic) and M-1 (vocational) nonimmigrant student statuses in the United States, covering individual applicant criteria, approved educational program types, and specific distinctions between the two visa classifications.\n\n**A. Applicant Eligibility (F-1 and M-1):**\nTo be eligible, an alien must:\n*   Be a bona fide student pursuing a full course of study.\n*   Intend to enter the U.S. temporarily and solely for study at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified institution.\n*   Maintain a foreign residence with no intention of abandoning it, demonstrating an intent to depart the U.S. after completing studies/authorized training.\n*   Possess a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20) issued by a Designated School Official (DSO) of an SEVP-certified school.\n*   Have sufficient funds for self-support throughout the entire study period. For F-1, funds must be available or will be available (first year typically needs to be readily available); for M-1, funds must be *immediately available* or supported by assurances for the *entire* stay.\n*   Pay the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) fee (Form I-901), if applicable.\n\n**B. Program Eligibility:**\n*   **F-1 Approved Schools:** Colleges, universities, community/junior colleges (liberal arts/professions), seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, private elementary schools, and institutions offering language, liberal arts, fine arts, professional, or multi-discipline training.\n*   **M-1 Approved Schools:** Community/junior colleges (vocational/technical), vocational high schools, and schools providing vocational or nonacademic training (excluding language training).\n*   **Ineligible School Types (for both F-1 and M-1):** Home schools, public elementary/middle schools, and adult education programs funded by federal, state, county, or municipal grants.\n*   **Designated School Officials (DSO) Responsibilities:** DSOs are dedicated employees at SEVP-certified schools responsible for overseeing and authorizing foreign student activities (e.g., reduced course loads, leaves of absence, employment endorsements like Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT), school transfers). They must update and maintain student records in SEVIS; failure to do so can result in disqualification or withdrawal of the school's SEVP certification.\n\n**C. Border Commuter Students:**\nNationals of Canada or Mexico who reside in their home country but commute to the U.S. for an approved F or M school are granted F-3 or M-3 nonimmigrant classification. They can study full-time or part-time and are admitted for a fixed period rather than duration of status.\n\n**Key Differences between F-1 and M-1 Students (from Appendices):**\n| Requirement           | F-1 (Academic)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | M-1 (Vocational)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Sufficient Funds**  | Funds available or will be available to study without unauthorized U.S. employment.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Funds immediately available or assurances of support for *all* tuition/living costs for the *entire* period of stay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| **Full-time Study**   | Required, unless DSO or Secretary of Homeland Security authorizes reduced course load.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Required, unless DSO authorizes reduced course load *for medical reasons only*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| **Public Schools**    | No K-8.

        "summary": "This document outlines regulations for F-1 and M-1 nonimmigrant students regarding courses, enrollment, and specific educational programs.\n\n**Key Regulations for F-1 and M-1 Students:**\n\n1.  **Public High School Attendance:**\n    *   **F-1 Students:** May attend public high school (grades 9-12) for a cumulative period of 12 months. They must reimburse the school for the full, unsubsidized per capita cost of education. F-1 students in public high school are typically admitted for a fixed period, not duration of status, and may need to file Form I-539 for extensions.\n    *   **M-1 Students:** May attend public high school (grades 9-12) without the 12-month limit, but their admission is for a fixed period (up to 1 year, including practical training and departure).\n    *   Neither F-1 nor M-1 students may attend public elementary or middle school, or publicly funded adult education programs.\n\n2.  **Online and Distance Education Courses:**\n    *   **F-1 Students:** Can only count one online class or three credits (or equivalent) per academic session towards their full course of study. Online classes do not count towards a full course of study for language programs. If only one course is needed to finish a program, it cannot be taken online; physical presence is required.\n    *   **M-1 Students:** No online or distance education classes count towards their full course of study requirement if they don't require physical attendance.\n    *   **COVID-19 Flexibilities Terminated:** As of May 11, 2023, COVID-19 related flexibilities for online learning are terminated for the 2023-24 academic year. New or re-entering students must comply with strict regulatory limits on online components.\n\n3.  **Other Education Programs:**\n    *   **Adult Education:** F-1 or M-1 students cannot enroll in adult education programs funded by federal, state, county, or municipal sources.\n    *   **English Language Training Programs:**\n        *   **F-1 Students:** Must enroll in programs accredited by a Department of Education-recognized agency. Online English language training courses do not count towards a full course of study. Time spent in such programs generally doesn't count towards the one academic year required for practical training, unless college credit is received from an SEVP-certified institution.\n        *   **M-1 Students:** Permitted only if their primary intent is vocational/technical training and English language training is taken at the same school solely to understand the vocational course.\n\n4.  **Concurrent Enrollment:**\n    *   **F-1 Students:** May enroll in two different SEVP-certified schools simultaneously if the combined enrollment constitutes a full course of study. The school from which the student will earn their degree issues the Form I-20 and handles reporting.\n    *   **M-1 Students:** Not permitted to be concurrently enrolled in two different SEVP-certified schools.\n\n5.  **Full Course of Study Requirements:** Students must maintain a full course of study leading to a specific educational or professional objective, as certified by a Designated School Official (DSO).\n    *   **F-1 Students:** Requirements vary by program level, including specific credit or clock hour minimums (e.g., at least 12 semester/quarter hours for undergraduate/postgraduate study, 18-22 clock hours for non-vocational programs depending on instruction type, minimum hours for high school).\n    *   **M-1 Students:** Requirements also vary, including at least 12 semester/quarter hours for community/junior college, 12 hours/week for postsecondary vocational/business programs, 18-22 clock hours/week for other nonacademic vocational programs, and minimum hours for high school. M-1 full course of study excludes language training unless it supports vocational study.\n    *   **Border Commuter Students:** Must be enrolled in a full course of study, though a DSO may authorize a reduced course load consistent with their certified program.\n\n6.  **Reduced Course Load (RCL):** Students must obtain DSO authorization before dropping to an RCL; otherwise, they are out of status.\n    *   **F-1 Students:** DSO may authorize RCL for:\n        *   **Specified Initial Academic Difficulties:** Once per program level (e.g., English language, U.S. teaching methods, improper placement). Student must take at least 6 semester/quarter hours or half the clock hours.\n        *   **Temporary Illness or Medical Condition:** One or more times, up to an aggregate of 12 months per program level. Requires documentation from a licensed medical professional. A \"no course load\" may be authorized.\n        *   **Completion of Course of Study:** In the final term if fewer courses are needed to graduate.\n    *   **M-1 Students:** DSO may authorize RCL only for **illness or medical condition** (documented by a licensed medical professional). Total RCL cannot exceed 5 months per course of study.\n    *   **Border Commuter Students:** Can be authorized for RCL for the same reasons as F-1/M-1 students, consistent with their certified course of study.\n\n**Updates:**\nRecent updates include the termination of COVID-19 flexibilities for online learning, new policy guidance on Optional Practical Training (OPT) and STEM OPT eligibility, clarifications on school transfers and the grace period, and comprehensive policy updates addressing F and M nonimmigrant student classifications, employment authorization, and change/reinstatement of status. Technical updates have also been made to terminology (\"noncitizen\" to \"alien\" and vice-versa).",

        "summary": "This document outlines the procedures and requirements for F-1 and M-1 international students seeking to transfer schools within the United States.\n\n**F-1 Students (Academic)**\n\n*   **Notification:** F-1 students maintaining status must notify their current Designated School Official (DSO) of their intent to transfer to another U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school. Transfers can occur even during the 60-day grace period post-completion of studies.\n*   **Status Requirement:** Students not pursuing a full course of study (unless authorized by a DSO for valid reasons) are considered out of status and ineligible for transfer. They must apply for reinstatement or depart the U.S. and return in a new F-1 status. If reinstatement is pending, students should maintain full-time enrollment.\n*   **Educational Levels:** Transfers are permitted between SEVP-certified schools at the same educational level or when progressing to a higher level (e.g., high school to bachelor's, bachelor's to master's).\n*   **Five-Month Limit:** Students must resume classes at the transfer school within 5 months of transferring out of their current school, or within 5 months of the program completion date on their current Form I-20, whichever is earlier. For those on post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT), classes must resume within 5 months of transferring out or by the OPT end date, whichever is earlier.\n*   **OPT Termination:** Authorization for Optional Practical Training (OPT) is automatically terminated upon transferring to another school or starting a new educational level.\n\n**M-1 Students (Vocational)**\n\n*   **Eligibility:** M-1 students generally cannot transfer schools after 6 months from their admission or change of status date. An exception exists if they were forced to leave their initial school due to circumstances beyond their control.\n    *   To be eligible, M-1 students must be bona fide nonimmigrants, have been pursuing a full course of study, intend to pursue a full course of study at the new school, and demonstrate financial ability to attend.\n*   **Procedure:**\n    1.  The M-1 student notifies their current school (transfer-out school) of the transfer intent, specifying the transfer-in school.\n    2.  The transfer-out school updates SEVIS with the transfer-in school and release date.\n    3.  The transfer-in school generates a new Form I-20.\n    4.  The student submits Form I-539 (Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status) to USCIS for permission.\n    5.  The student may enroll at the transfer-in school's next available term/session and must notify the transfer-in school's DSO immediately upon attendance.\n    6.  The transfer-in school updates the student's registration in SEVIS.\n*   **USCIS Approval:** If Form I-539 is approved, the Form I-20 program start date is the transfer approval date, and an extension of stay is granted for the lesser of the new course duration plus 30 days, or a total of 1 year. Denial of Form I-539 results in the student being out of status.\n*   **Full Course of Study:** M-1 students not pursuing a full course of study must be granted reinstatement before being eligible to transfer.\n\n**Key Differences (F-1 vs. M-1 Transfers from Appendices):**\n\n| Requirement        | F-1 (Academic)                                               | M-1 (Vocational)                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **School Transfers** | Allowed, DSO must record in SEVIS.                           | Allowed if less than 6 months into the program and unable to remain at the present school due to circumstances beyond their control.

        "summary": "This document outlines the regulations and procedures for practical training (PT) available to F-1 (academic) and M-1 (vocational) nonimmigrant students in the United States. Practical training allows students to gain employment experience directly related to their major area of study.\n\n**General Requirements for Practical Training (PT):**\n*   Students must be lawfully enrolled full-time for at least one full academic year at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified institution.\n*   Students in English language training programs are ineligible for PT.\n\n**I. F-1 Student Curricular Practical Training (CPT):**\n*   **Definition:** Alternative work-study, cooperative education, or required internships/practicums offered through school-employer cooperative agreements, integral to an established curriculum.\n*   **Authorization:** No USCIS application or Employment Authorization Document (EAD) (Form I-766) is required. Authorization is granted by the student's Designated School Official (DSO) and annotated on Form I-20.\n*   **Timing:** Occurs before the program end date, can be part-time or full-time.\n*   **Limitations:** One year or more of full-time CPT at the same educational level makes a student ineligible for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT).\n*   **Eligibility:** Must have completed one full academic year (with exceptions for certain graduate programs), be enrolled full-time, obtain DSO endorsement, and participate in an approved program.\n\n**II. F-1 Student Optional Practical Training (OPT):**\nOPT can be authorized pre-completion or post-completion of a degree program. Students are generally allowed 12 months of OPT per higher educational level. Each period requires a DSO recommendation and USCIS authorization (EAD).\n\n**A. Pre-Completion OPT:**\n*   **Timing:** While school is in session (max 20 hours/week) or during breaks (full-time allowed).\n*   **Application:** File Form I-765 with USCIS after DSO recommendation.\n*   **Start Date:** Must not begin before the date on the EAD.\n*   **Eligibility:** DSO recommendation, full-time enrollment at SEVP-certified school, completed one full academic year (or within 90 days of completion), valid EAD, not an English language student, maintain full course of study.\n*   **Limitations:** Incremental and cumulative up to 12 months. Any time used for pre-completion OPT is deducted from the post-completion OPT period at the same educational level.\n\n**B. Post-Completion OPT:**\n*   **Eligibility:** Completed course of study (or all course requirements excluding thesis), not an English language student, DSO recommendation, valid EAD, and not having completed one year or more of full-time CPT.\n*   **Work:** Volunteer or unpaid internships are allowed if related to study and at least 20 hours/week.\n*   **Start Date:** On the date USCIS adjudicates or DSO requests, whichever is later, but no more than 60 days after program end.\n*   **Limitations:** Must be completed within 14 months of study completion. An aggregate of no more than 90 days of unemployment is allowed.\n*   **Grace Period:** A 60-day grace period is granted after EAD expiration for departure, change of education level, transfer, or status change.\n*   **Termination:** OPT (including STEM OPT) automatically terminates upon school transfer, new degree level at the same school, change to different nonimmigrant status, failure to maintain F-1 status, or school closure.\n\n**C. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) OPT Extension:**\n*   **Eligibility:** F-1 student, currently in a valid post-completion OPT period, earned a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree in a STEM-designated field from an accredited, SEVP-certified U.S. school.\n*   **Employer Requirements:** Must be E-Verify enrolled, maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship, provide at least 20 hours/week employment, implement a formal training program, offer duties/hours/compensation commensurate with U.S. workers, and complete a Training Plan for STEM OPT Students (Form I-983). Employers cannot delegate training responsibilities to third parties.\n*   **Limitations:** 24-month extension, granted once per qualifying degree. An aggregate of no more than 150 days of unemployment (including initial OPT) is allowed.\n*   **Application:** File Form I-765 with USCIS up to 90 days before current OPT EAD expiration and no more than 60 days after DSO recommendation in SEVIS. Timely filed applications allow continued work for up to 180 days after current OPT expires or until USCIS decision.\n*   **Previously/Future STEM Degrees:** May be eligible for extension based on a prior STEM degree (within 10 years) or a second STEM extension for a higher STEM degree.\n*   **Evaluation Requirement:** Students must submit 12-month and concluding self-evaluations (signed by student and employer) of their progress towards training goals described in Form I-983 to the DSO.\n*   **Training Plan Modifications:** Any material changes to the training plan require a modified Form I-983 to be submitted to the DSO.\n\n**D. OPT Reporting and Employment Requirements:**\n*   F-1 students on OPT must report changes of name, address, employer, or employment interruption to their DSO within 10 days.\n*   STEM OPT students have additional reporting requirements:\n    *   Report changes (name, address, employer, loss of employment) within 10 days.\n    *   Submit a validation report every 6 months confirming current information to the DSO.\n    *   Submit required 12-month and final self-evaluations (Form I-983).\n    *   Submit a new Form I-983 for a new employer within 10 days.\n    *   Submit a modified Form I-983 for any material changes to the training plan.\n\n**E. OPT Filing:**\n*   Form I-765 required for all OPT.\n*   **Pre-completion:** Up to 90 days before completing one academic year.\n*   **Post-completion:** 90 days prior to program end date to 60 days after, and within 30 days of DSO's SEVIS recommendation.\n*   **STEM OPT:** Up to 90 days before current OPT EAD expiration and no more than 60 days after DSO's SEVIS recommendation.\n\n**III. F-1 \"Cap-gap\" Extension:**\n*   **Purpose:** Automatically extends F-1 status and employment authorization for F-1 students with a timely-filed, cap-subject H-1B petition requesting a change of status, bridging the gap between F-1 status expiration and H-1B start date (typically October 1).\n*   **Eligibility:** Must be authorized for OPT employment, not have violated status, H-1B petition timely filed (while F-1 status/OPT was valid), and H-1B requested an October 1 start.\n*   **Limitations:** Students in the 60-day grace period at the time of H-1B filing receive status extension but not employment authorization. Unemployment during cap-gap counts towards cumulative limits.\n*   **Termination:** Ends on October 1 or if the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, revoked, or withdrawn.\n*   **Travel:** Generally allowed if H-1B petition and change of status are approved, and seeking readmission before October 1. Travel while H-1B change of status is pending abandons the change of status request.\n\n**IV. M-1 Practical Training (PT):**\n*   **Authorization:** Only available *after* course completion.\n*   **Purpose:** Allows M-1 students to get on-the-job training not available in their home country, related to their course of study.\n*   **Application:** M-1 students must obtain DSO recommendation and file Form I-765 (and Form I-539 if status extension is needed) with USCIS no more than 90 days before their program end date.\n*   **Duration:** 1 month of authorization for every 4 months of full-time study, not to exceed an aggregate of 6 months.\n*   **Start Date:** Must not begin employment until USCIS has issued an EAD.",

        "summary": "This document, Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual, outlines regulations for F-1 (academic) and M-1 (vocational) students regarding absences from the United States and readmission.\n\n**Key Points for F-1 Students:**\n*   **Temporary Absence (5 months or less):** F-1 students can be readmitted by presenting a current Form I-20 (endorsed by the DSO, or updated if substantive changes occurred) and a valid F nonimmigrant visa (unless exempt).\n*   **Absence Exceeding 5 Months:** If unable to remain enrolled at their SEVP-certified school, students lose status and must seek readmission in \"initial status,\" requiring a new Form I-20.\n*   **Optional Practical Training (OPT):** Time spent outside the U.S. counts toward the maximum allowed unemployment period for OPT. To re-enter for OPT, students need a current visa (if applicable), an I-20 endorsed for travel by their DSO within the last 6 months, and an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\n*   For F-1 study abroad programs, students should refer to the DHS Study in the States webpage.\n\n**Key Points for M-1 Students:**\n*   **Temporary Absence:** M-1 students returning to attend their authorized school must present a properly endorsed Form I-20 (or a new one if substantive changes occurred) and a valid M nonimmigrant visa (unless exempt).\n*   **School Transfers:** If a transfer to a new school was authorized by USCIS, the visa does not need to specify the new school name for readmission.\n*   **Practical Training:** M-1 students can be readmitted for previously authorized practical training. However, they cannot be admitted to *begin* practical training that was not authorized before their departure. An Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765) will be denied if the student departs the U.S. while it's pending.\n\n**General F-1 vs. M-1 Student Requirements (from Appendices):**\nBoth F-1 and M-1 students require acceptance at an SEVP-certified school and must be bona fide students pursuing a full course of study. Key differences include:\n*   **Funds:** F-1s need sufficient funds without resorting to unauthorized employment; M-1s need immediately available funds for all tuition and living costs for their entire stay.\n*   **Public Schools:** F-1s can study at SEVP-certified public high schools (grades 9-12) for up to 12 months if the unsubsidized cost is paid; M-1s cannot study at public schools for K-8.\n*   **School Transfers:** F-1 transfers are recorded in SEVIS by the DSO. M-1 transfers require USCIS authorization, typically if less than 6 months into the program, due to circumstances beyond their control, and without changing educational objective.\n*   **Practical Training:** F-1s are eligible for Curricular Practical Training (CPT), pre-completion OPT, post-completion OPT, and STEM OPT Extension, all requiring DSO endorsement and/or USCIS approval/EAD. M-1s are only eligible for post-completion practical training, which must be related to their course of study, unavailable in their home country, and requires USCIS approval/EAD.\n*   **Maximum Stay:** F-1 status is \"Duration of Status\"; M-1 is 1 year, with extensions not to exceed 3 years cumulatively.\n*   **Program Extension:** F-1 extensions require compelling academic or medical reasons and DSO approval before the I-20 expires. M-1 extensions (up to 3 years total) require filing Form I-539 with USCIS.\n*   **Family Members:** Both F-1 and M-1 students' spouses and unmarried children under 21 are eligible for F-2 and M-2 visa classifications, respectively.\n\n**Updates:**\nThe document has undergone various technical updates, including changes in terminology (e.g., \"noncitizen\" vs. \"alien\"), clarifications on OPT, online study, school transfers, grace periods, study abroad programs, and the incorporation of Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. It also reflects updates aligning with the 2020 Fee Rule.",

        "summary": "This document outlines the regulations regarding Change of Status (COS), Extension of Stay, and Length of Stay for F-1 (academic) and M-1 (vocational) nonimmigrant students in the United States.\n\n**1. General Eligibility for Change of Status to F-1**\n*   **Eligibility:** Nonimmigrants lawfully admitted, maintaining valid status, without violations, and meriting a favorable exercise of discretion may apply for a Change of Status (COS) to F-1.\n*   **Timing:** F-1 status becomes effective on the date USCIS approves the COS application. If approved more than 30 days before the program start date, the individual must maintain their F-1 status by not engaging in impermissible activities (e.g., employment) until 30 days before the program start. USCIS no longer requires \"bridging\" applications to cover gaps in status while a COS to F-1 is pending, provided the initial application was filed while in lawful status.\n*   **Study Restrictions:** Nonimmigrants in classifications that do not permit full-time study (e.g., B-1/B-2 visitors) must obtain F-1 status first. Those in classifications allowing incidental study may continue while COS is pending, but F-1 specific activities require approval and the 30-day window.\n*   **Travel Abroad:** A pending COS application is considered abandoned if the applicant travels abroad. Re-admission in F-1 status is prohibited more than 30 days before the Form I-20 report/start date.\n\n**2. Vocational Student (M-1)**\n*   This section is reserved in the policy manual, but details are provided in other sections regarding M-1 eligibility, extensions, and length of stay.\n\n**3. Extension of Stay**\n*   **F-1 Students:** Admitted for \"duration of status\" (D/S), meaning no USCIS extension application is required as long as they maintain status and make normal academic progress.\n    *   **Program Extension:** If an F-1 student cannot complete their program by the I-20 end date due to compelling academic or medical reasons, their Designated School Official (DSO) may grant an extension *before* the I-20 expires. Delays due to academic probation/suspension are not valid reasons.\n    *   **Reinstatement:** If an F-1 student falls out of status, they may apply for reinstatement using Form I-539, accompanied by a DSO-recommended Form I-20. Criteria include filing within 5 months (or exceptional circumstances), no repeated violations, intent to pursue a full course of study, no unauthorized employment, and a favorable exercise of discretion, often due to circumstances beyond their control.\n*   **M-1 Students:** Cumulative time of extensions, including practical training, cannot exceed 3 years from the original start date.\n    *   **Application:** M-1 students must apply to USCIS for an extension using Form I-539 at least 15 days, but not more than 60 days, before the I-20 end date. They must demonstrate compelling educational or medical reasons for the delay and intent to maintain status.\n    *   **Period of Stay:** Extensions are granted for the period needed to complete the course plus 30 days to depart, or for a total of 1 year, whichever is less.\n    *   **Reinstatement:** Similar to F-1, M-1 students can request reinstatement via Form I-539, meeting conditions such as filing within 5 months, no willful violations, and pursuing a full course, with circumstances beyond their control often being a factor.\n\n**4. Length of Stay**\n*   **F-1 Students:** Admitted for \"duration of status\" (D/S), meaning they can remain as long as they maintain their full course of study or authorized practical training. They can be admitted up to 30 days before the I-20 start date.\n*   **M-1 Students:** Admitted for a fixed period, which is the time needed to complete the course, plus any authorized practical training, plus 30 days for departure. The total period cannot exceed 1 year. They can be admitted up to 30 days before the I-20 start date.\n\n**5. Duration of Status (F nonimmigrants)**\n*   This refers to the unspecified period F-1 nonimmigrants can remain in the U.S. while maintaining student status (full course of study or authorized practical training) without needing to apply for extensions with USCIS.\n\n**6.

Each dependent needs an original Form I-20. A new I-20 is required for substantive changes in the student's information.\n*   **Employment and Study Restrictions:**\n    *   F-2 and M-2 dependents are **not authorized to work** in the United States.\n    *   They are permitted to attend elementary, middle, and high school on a full-time basis.\n    *   They can also engage in avocational or recreational study, or study on a less than full-time basis.\n    *   To pursue a full course of study beyond elementary/secondary school or avocational/recreational levels, a dependent must change status to F-1 or M-1.\n*   **Period of Stay:**\n    *   **F-2 Dependents:** Generally admitted for the \"duration of status\" concurrently with the F-1 student, and do not need to seek an extension as long as the F-1 maintains status. The Designated School Official (DSO) updates SEVIS for both F-1 and F-2 if an extension is granted to the F-1.\n    *   **M-2 Dependents:** Admitted for a fixed period, generally for the same duration as the M-1 student. Extensions, if granted, apply to all family members for the shortest period granted to any, and may not exceed a total of 1 year or the date a dependent loses eligibility (e.g., child turns 21).\n*   **Change of Status:** Spouses and minor children can file Form I-539 to change to F-2 dependent status while their current nonimmigrant status is valid. If the principal nonimmigrant's change of status application is denied, the dependent's application must also be denied.\n\n**Updates:** The policy manual has undergone several technical updates, including changes in terminology (e.g., \"noncitizen\" vs. \"alien\"), integration of Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content, alignment with the 2020 Fee Schedule Final Rule, and issuance of policy guidance regarding F and M classifications.",
