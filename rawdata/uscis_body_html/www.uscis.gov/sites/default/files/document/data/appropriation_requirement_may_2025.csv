"5) ""Pending Over Six Months"" is the number of applications pending a decision more than six months after receipt, as of the end of the reporting period.",,,,,,,
"6) ""Avg.

",,,,,,,
"7) This report is produced in response to direction set forth in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Joint Explanatory Statement (H. R. 2471 / P.L. 117-103).",,,,,,,
"8) Some applications or petitions approved, denied, or pending a decision may have been received in previous reporting periods.",,,,,,,
9) The report reflects the most up-to-date estimate available at the time the database is queried and may differ from other published reports.,,,,,,,

"12) In March 2025, USCIS issued a Federal Register notice for termination of parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaragua, and Venezuelans. As part of this termination process, USCIS issued notices to aliens with an approved Employment Authorization Document (EADs  ) based on their parole (category (c)(11)). This action reverted previously approved (c)(11) EADs to a pending status. In April 2025, a stay was issued (Svitlana Doe, et al., v. Noem, et. al., No. 25-cv-10495 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025)) , which temporarily halted the implementation of those actions. As a result, the pending (c)(11) EADs were reverted back to an approved status. These actions resulted in significant changes in pending and completed (c)(11) EADs. This report reflects operational activity during a specific time period only.         ",,,,,,,
