H1: Emergency Travel

This page is for aliens in the United States who need to travel outside of the United States because of an emergency and are seeking a travel document to authorize their return.

If you are already outside the United States and need to return, but do not have your reentry permit, Green Card, or advance parole document because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, seeForm I-131A, Application for Carrier Documentation(Carrier Documentation) page.

Overview

If you are currently inside the United States and need to leave the United States because of an emergency, you should know what documents you will need to reenter the United States. You also should understand whether leaving the United States could negatively affect your immigration status or pending applications for immigration benefits.

If you are returning to the United States after temporary travel abroad, you generally must have in your possession either:

- A valid entry document, such as a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) or nonimmigrant visa; or

- A valid and unexpired travel document, such as a reentry permit, refugee travel document, or advance parole document.

You generally need to apply for and obtain a travel document before you leave the United States. You may request a travel document by filingForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records.
