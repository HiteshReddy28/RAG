If we granted you or your dependents conditional permanent resident status on the basis of investment in a new commercial enterprise, you must file Form I-829 during the 90-day period immediately before your conditional residence expires. The expiration date on your Green Card is also the date of your second anniversary as a conditional permanent resident.

Visit ourWhen to File Your Petition to Remove Conditions, page to determine the first day of your 90-day filing window. If you file your petition before that date, we may reject it.

If you do not apply to remove the conditions within the 90-day period, we will terminate your conditional permanent resident status and you will become removable from the United States. However, if your failure to file within that 90-day period was for good cause and due to extenuating circumstances, you may file your petition late with a written explanation and request that USCIS, in its discretion, excuse your late filing.

For further information, please review the Form I-829 instructions.
