H1: I-485 Supplement J,Confirmation of Valid Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j)

Use Supplement J to:

- Confirm that the job offered to you inForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, remains a valid job offer that you intend to accept when we approve yourForm I 485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. If you are filing or previously filed Form I-485 based on being the beneficiary of a valid Form I-140 in an employment-based immigrant visa category that requires a job offer, you must file Supplement J instead of submitting a job offer letter; or

- Request job portability under INA section 204(j) to a new, full-time, permanent job offer that you intend to accept when we approve your Form I-485. This new job offer must be in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job offered to you in the Form I-140 that is the basis of your Form I-485. For more information about how we determine which jobs are the same or similar, please see USCIS Policy Manual [7 USCIS-PM E.5].
