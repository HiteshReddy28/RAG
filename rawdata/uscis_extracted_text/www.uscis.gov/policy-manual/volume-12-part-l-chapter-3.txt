H1: Chapter 3 - Effects of Revocation of Naturalization

- Appendices (1)

- Updates (5)

H2: A. Effective Date of Revocation of Naturalization

The revocation of a person’s U.S. citizenship obtained through naturalization is effective as of the original date of naturalization.[1]The person returns to his or her immigration status before becoming a U.S. citizen as of the date of naturalization shown on the person’s Certificate of Naturalization.

H2: B. Cancellation of Certificate of Naturalization

If a court revokes a person’s U.S. citizenship obtained through naturalization, the court enters an order revoking the person’s naturalization and cancelling the person’s Certificate of Naturalization. In such cases, the person must surrender his or her Certificate of Naturalization. Once USCIS obtains the court’s order revoking citizenship and cancelling the certificate, USCIS updates its records, including electronic records, and notifies the Department of State of the person’s revocation of naturalization. All cases relating to cancellation of certificates should be coordinated through the USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel office with jurisdiction.[2]

H2: C. Effects of Revocation on Citizenship of Certain Spouses and Children[3]

H3: 1. General Effects of Person’s Revocation on Citizenship of Spouse or Child

In general, certain spouses and children of persons who naturalize may become U.S. citizens through their spouses or parents’ citizenship. A spouse may become a U.S. citizen through the special spousal provisions for naturalization.[4]A child residing in the United States or abroad may become a U.S. citizen through his or her parent’s naturalization.[5]In general, the spouse or child of a person whose citizenship has been revoked cannot become a U.S. citizen on the basis that he or she is the spouse or child of that person.[6]

In addition, the citizen spouse or citizen child of a person whose citizenship has been revoked may lose his or her citizenship upon the parent or spouse’s revocation of naturalization. This depends on the basis of the revocation, and in some cases, on whether the spouse or child resides in the United States at the time of the revocation.

For example, the citizenship of a spouse or child who became a U.S. citizen through the naturalization of his or her parent or spouse is not lost if the revocation was based on illegal procurement of naturalization. The spouse or child’s citizenship may be lost, however, if the revocation was based on other grounds (see below).

In cases where the spouse or child loses his or her citizenship, the spouse or child loses any right or privilege of U.S. citizenship which he or she has, may have, or may acquire through the parent or spouse’s naturalization. The spouse or child returns to the status that he or she had before becoming a U.S. citizen.[7]

H3: 2. Citizenship of Spouse or Child is Lost if Revocation for Concealment or Misrepresentation

The spouse or child of a person whose U.S. citizenship is revoked loses his or her U.S. citizenship at the time of revocation in cases where:

- The spouse or child became a U.S. citizen through the naturalization of his or her parent or spouse whose citizenship has been revoked; and

- The parent or spouse’s citizenship was revoked on the ground that his or her naturalization was procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.[8]

The spouse or child became a U.S. citizen through the naturalization of his or her parent or spouse whose citizenship has been revoked; and

The parent or spouse’s citizenship was revoked on the ground that his or her naturalization was procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.[8]

This provision applies regardless of whether the spouse or child is residing in the United States or abroad at the time of the revocation of naturalization.[9]

H3: 3. Citizenship of Spouse or Child Residing Abroad is Lost if Revocation on Certain Grounds

The spouse or child of a person whose U.S. citizenship is revoked may lose his or her U.S. citizenship if the spouse or child is residing outside of the United States at the time of revocation.[10]This applies if the revocation was based on becoming a member of certain organizations after naturalization or for separating from the military under less than honorable conditions before serving honorably for five years.

The spouse or child of a person whose U.S. citizenship is revoked under these sections may lose his or her U.S. citizenship at the time of revocation in cases where:

- The spouse or child became a United States citizen through the naturalization of his or her parent or spouse whose citizenship has been revoked;

- The spouse or child resided outside of the United States at the time of revocation; and

- The parent or spouse’s citizenship was revoked on the basis that:

- The person became involved with the Communist party, other totalitarian party, or terrorist organization within five years of his or her naturalization;[11]or

- The person naturalized on the basis of service in the U.S. armed forces but separated from the military under other than honorable conditions before serving honorably for a period or periods totaling at least five years.[12]

The spouse or child became a United States citizen through the naturalization of his or her parent or spouse whose citizenship has been revoked;

The spouse or child resided outside of the United States at the time of revocation; and

The parent or spouse’s citizenship was revoked on the basis that:

The person became involved with the Communist party, other totalitarian party, or terrorist organization within five years of his or her naturalization;[11]or

The person naturalized on the basis of service in the U.S. armed forces but separated from the military under other than honorable conditions before serving honorably for a period or periods totaling at least five years.[12]

The spouse or child’s loss of citizenship under this provision does not apply if the spouse or child was residing in the United States at the time of revocation.[13]

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
