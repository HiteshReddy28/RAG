H2: A. Purpose

An alien who is admitted to the United States as a permanent resident, or who adjusts status to permanent residence, based on a qualifying marriage less than 2 years old is required to meet certain conditions after the alien’s admission or adjustment of status.[1]This alien, known as a conditional permanent resident (CPR), receives permanent resident status on a conditional basis for 2 years. A CPR’s child may also obtain CPR status.[2]

This part of the Policy Manual only discusses family-based CPRs.[3]

H2: B. Background

Before 1986, the law did not place conditions on an alien who obtained permanent resident status through a qualifying marriage less than 2 years old. Instead, the alien immediately received lawful permanent resident status without conditions. However, Congress believed that a significant number of aliens might have entered into these marriages to evade the U.S. immigration laws.[4]

Therefore, Congress enacted the Immigration Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 (IMFA) to discourage the use of fraudulent marriages to obtain permanent residence in the United States.[5]Congress created conditions and a second review of the bona fides of the marriage to ensure that the alien entered into the marriage in good faith and not for the sole purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
