- Updates (19)

H2: A. Background

In addition to the general provisions for naturalization, including the provision for alien military service members under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 328, Congress also provided a special provision for service during specific hostilities.[1]This provision has its origins in similar provisions that were enacted starting after World War I in recognition of the honorable service and sacrifice of aliens during times of war.

H2: B. General Eligibility through Military Service during Hostilities

Members of the U.S. armed forces who serve honorably for any period of time during specifically designated periods of hostilities may be eligible to naturalize.[2]

The alien must establish that he or she meets all of the following criteria in order to qualify:

- The alien may be of any age.

- The alien must have served honorably in the U.S. armed forces during a designated period of hostility.

- The alien must either be a lawful permanent resident (LPR) or have been physically present at the time of enlistment, reenlistment, or extension of service or induction into the U.S. armed forces:In the United States,[3]the Canal Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island, orOn board a public vessel owned or operated by the United States for noncommercial service.

- In the United States,[3]the Canal Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island, or

- On board a public vessel owned or operated by the United States for noncommercial service.

- The alien must be able to read, write, and speak basic English.

- The alien must demonstrate knowledge of U.S. history and government.

- The alien must demonstrate good moral character for at least 1 year prior to filing the application until the time of his or her naturalization.

- The alien must have an attachment to the principles of the U.S. Constitution and be well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States during all relevant periods under the law.

- In the United States,[3]the Canal Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island, or

- On board a public vessel owned or operated by the United States for noncommercial service.

An alien who files on the basis of military service during hostilities is exempt from the general naturalization requirements of continuous residence and physical presence.[4]

As with all cases, all pertinent background checks, including applicable U.S. Department of War (DOW) checks (if required)[5]must be completed before USCIS may interview the alien applying for naturalization.

H2: C. Honorable Service

H3: 1. Qualifying Military Service

Qualifying military service is honorable service in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or active duty service in the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, or Coast Guard. Service in the National Guard may also qualify.[6]In general, international cadets attending U.S. military academies are not considered to have served in the U.S. armed forces.[7]

Honorable service means service in the U.S. armed forces that is designated as honorable service by the executive department under which the alien performed that military service.

Current Military Service

An alien military service member who applies for naturalization based on his or her service during specific hostilities[8]and who is serving in the U.S. armed forces at the time he or she files the naturalization application must have his or her service certified as honorable by his or her military branch. The alien military service member is responsible for submitting to USCIS a complete and certified Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service (Form N-426).[9]

Past Military Service

An alien service member who applies for naturalization based on his or her service during specific hostilities[10]and who is separated from the U.S. armed forces at the time he or she files the naturalization application must submit a copy of his or her official discharge documentation. The U.S. armed forces generally issue a “Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty” (DD Form 214) or National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service (NGB Form 22) upon the alien military service member’s release from active duty service.

Military discharge characterizations indicate the nature of a military service member’s separation and can impact eligibility for naturalization.INA 329requires honorable service and, if the alien has separated from service, a separation under honorable conditions.[11]

As illustrated in the table below, the U.S. Department of War (DOW) authorizes six characterizations of service for military service members to receive on discharge:[12]

TABLE:
Service Characterization or Separation Description[13] | Description of Discharge or Separation Type | Qualifies as “Under Honorable Conditions” for Naturalization Purposes?
Honorable | The service member generally has met the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty for service members or is otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization would be inappropriate.[14] | Yes
General (Under Honorable Conditions) | The service member has served honestly and faithfully. The positive aspects of the enlisted service member’s conduct or performance of duty outweigh the negative aspects of the enlisted service member’s conduct or performance of duty as documented in their service record.[15] | Yes
Uncharacterized | When a characterization of service or other description of separation is not authorized or warranted, administrative separations of service members may be uncharacterized.The service member may receive an uncharacterized discharge under the following circumstances:Entry-level separations;Void enlistment or induction; orDropping from the rolls.[16] | No, if discharge was after August 1, 2024
Other than Honorable Conditions | The service member may be issued this characterization when:The reason for separation is based on a pattern of behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of enlisted service members; orThe reason for separation is based on one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant departure from the conduct expected of enlisted service members.[17]Examples of factors that may be considered include but are not limited to, the use of force or violence to produce serious bodily injury or death, acts or omissions that endanger U.S. security, or deliberate acts or omissions that seriously endanger the health and safety of others. | No
Bad Conduct | This is not issued administratively and is considered a punitive separation and can only occur after a court-martial proceeding. | No
Dishonorable | This is not issued administratively and is considered a punitive separation and can only occur after a court-martial proceeding. | No

When a characterization of service or other description of separation is not authorized or warranted, administrative separations of service members may be uncharacterized.

The service member may receive an uncharacterized discharge under the following circumstances:

- Entry-level separations;

- Void enlistment or induction; or

- Dropping from the rolls.[16]

The service member may be issued this characterization when:

- The reason for separation is based on a pattern of behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of enlisted service members; or

- The reason for separation is based on one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant departure from the conduct expected of enlisted service members.[17]

Examples of factors that may be considered include but are not limited to, the use of force or violence to produce serious bodily injury or death, acts or omissions that endanger U.S. security, or deliberate acts or omissions that seriously endanger the health and safety of others.

As noted in the table, only “Honorable” and “General (Under Honorable Conditions)” discharges meet the statutory provisions requiring that an alien was separated “under honorable conditions,” because these are the only discharges that indicate honorable service.”[18]Other discharge types, such as “Uncharacterized,”[19]“Other Than Honorable,” “Bad Conduct,” and “Dishonorable,” do not qualify as a separation under honorable conditions.

Both “Honorable” and “General (Under Honorable Conditions)” are defined as types of “Characterized” service, and therefore “Uncharacterized”[20]discharges do not meet the “under honorable conditions” requirement. Notwithstanding, uncharacterized discharges issued before August 1, 2024, meet the “under honorable conditions” requirement, because the Department of Defense Instructions (DODI) had treated an uncharacterized discharge as “the required characterization” for “administrative matters” before August 1, 2024.[21]

The then-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) updated the DODI on August 1, 2024,[22]which removed the language regarding an uncharacterized discharge being treated as “the required characterization” for administrative matters and addressed entry-level separations as a distinct and separate category of discharges apart from honorable and general (under honorable conditions) discharges. Therefore, only uncharacterized discharges issued on or before July 31, 2024, qualify as “under honorable conditions” for naturalization purposes.

Discharges Based on Refusal to Comply with COVID-19 Vaccination Mandates

On August 24, 2021, and November 30, 2021, the then-Secretary of Defense mandated that members of the U.S. armed forces be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Consequently, service members who refused to comply with the mandates were discharged from active duty. The then-Secretary of Defense later rescinded the mandates on January 10, 2023, and rendered all then-DOD component policies, directives, and guidance implementing those vaccination mandates as no longer in effect.[23]Under the then-DOD policy announced on January 10, 2023, DOW permits individuals who separated or were discharged from the military to request a change in the "characterization of their discharge" in their personnel records.[24]

For the purposes of meeting eligibility for naturalization under INA 329, USCIS reviews the Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service (NGB Form 22), or other official discharge document to determine if the qualifying military service was both honorable service and that the alien has been separated under honorable conditions.[25]An alien who believes his or her discharge was incorrectly characterized due to refusal to comply to COVID-19 vaccination requirements may seek an upgrade to their discharge characterization through their respective military departments before applying for naturalization.[26]

H3: 2. Multiple Periods of Service

Aliens who have multiple periods of service must demonstrate that they have at least one qualifying period of service to establish eligibility underINA 329. A qualifying period of service is a period of service during which the applicant served honorably as a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve or on active duty in the U.S. armed forces during a designated period of hostilities, and if separated, was separated under honorable conditions.

Therefore, an alien who was separated under honorable conditions from a qualifying period of service may be eligible for naturalization under INA 329 even if the alien received a different type of discharge from any other period of service, including during a designated period of hostilities.

For example, an alien may have enlisted in October 1975, and served honorably on active duty for one entire period of service until 1978. The alien is honorably discharged and immediately reenlists for a second period of service for 2 more years starting in 1978 and ending in 1980. During the second period of service (1978-1980), the alien is discharged under “other than honorable conditions.” This alien, if able to demonstrate good moral character and meet all other naturalization requirements, is eligible to naturalize under INA 329 based on the first qualifying period of service (1975-1978).

Similarly, an alien who was previously separated with a discharge type that was not under honorable conditions, but subsequently reenlisted or was reinstated to service, may qualify for naturalization based upon the subsequent qualifying period of service if the executive department under which the alien performed the subsequent period of service certifies that the alien served honorably and, if separated, was separated under honorable conditions.

H2: D. National Guard Service

An alien filing on the basis of military service during hostilities[27]who has National Guard service may qualify if the alien has honorable service in either the U.S. armed forces or in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve.[28]USCIS does not require proof of federal activation for a National Guard applicant if the alien served in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve during a designated period of hostility.[29]The alien service member is responsible for submitting to USCIS a complete and certified Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service (Form N-426) (if currently serving), or if not currently serving, a National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service (NGB Form 22) or other official discharge document for all periods of service.[30]

The National Guard determines when one of its members is a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve; however, most National Guard members adhere to Selected Reserve training requirements and are members of the Selected Reserve of their respective services.

When a National Guard member is a member of the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve, the member may apply for naturalization underINA 329based on that service, if otherwise eligible. The applicant does not need to have active duty service or be part of the National Guard during such time as the unit is federally recognized as a reserve component of the armed forces in order to qualify under INA 329.

H2: E. Designated Periods of Hostilities

The INA and Presidential Executive Orders have designated the following military engagements and ranges of dates as periods of hostilities.[31]

TABLE:
Designated Periods of Hostilities
World War I[32] | April 6, 1917 | → | November 11, 1918
World War II[33] | September 1, 1939 | → | December 31, 1946
Korean Conflict[34] | June 25, 1950 | → | July 1, 1955
Vietnam Hostilities[35] | February 28, 1961 | → | October 15, 1978
Persian Gulf Conflict[36] | August 2, 1990 | → | April 11, 1991
War on Terrorism[37] | September 11, 2001 | → | Present

On July 3, 2002, President George W. Bush issuedExecutive Order 13269, which has designated a period of hostilities and has permitted the expedited naturalization for aliens eligible underINA 329as of September 11, 2001. The current designated period continues to be a designated period of hostilities forINA 329purposes until the President issues a new Executive Order terminating the designation.[38]

H2: F. Eligibility as Permanent Resident or if Present in United States at Induction or Enlistment

In general, an alien who files on the basis of military service during hostilities[39]is not required to be an LPR if he or she was physically present at the time of induction, enlistment, reenlistment, or extension of service in the U.S. armed forces:

- In the United States, the Canal Zone, American Samoa, or Swains Island; or

- On board a public vessel owned or operated by the United States for noncommercial service.

In addition, an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence after enlistment or induction is also eligible for naturalization under this provision regardless of the place of enlistment or induction.

H2: G. Conditional Permanent Residence and Naturalization during Hostilities

If the alien is a conditional permanent resident and is eligible to naturalize on the basis of military service during hostilities[40]without being an LPR based on being in the United States during enlistment or induction, the alien is not required to file or have an approved Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) before his or her Application for Naturalization (Form N-400) may be approved.

H2: H. Military Accessions Vital to National Interest Program

The general guidance in this section is from information provided by the DOW on its former Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program. USCIS is providing this general information in the Policy Manual to assist current and former service members and their families.

H3: 1. Background

In 2009, the then-U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) authorized the MAVNI pilot program as a recruitment tool to enlist certain nonimmigrants and other aliens who had skills that were considered vital to the national interest of the United States. The program applied to certain health care professionals and aliens who were fluent in certain foreign languages.

Then-DOD allowed authorization for the MAVNI program to expire on September 30, 2017, and has not renewed the program since that time. As a result, all individuals enlisting in the military are currently required to be U.S. citizens or nationals, lawful permanent residents of the United States, or citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or Palau (countries with which the United States has Compacts of Free Association allowing their citizens to enlist in the U.S. armed forces).[41]

An alien entering active duty status or service in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve may apply for military naturalization after the alien’s Request for Certification of Military or Naval Service (Form N-426) has been properly authorized, completed, and signed by the appropriate person authorized by DOW.[42]USCIS is unable to adjudicate a naturalization application for current service members without a properly submitted Form N-426.

Calixto Settlement Agreement Applicants

On September 22, 2022, the U.S. Army entered into a settlement agreement to settleCalixto, et al., v. U.S. Dep’t of the Army, et al.(Calixto Agreement).[43]In the settlement agreement, the Army agreed to certifyForms N-426for certain Army enlistees, including some enlistees who never began a qualifying period of service in the Army. By certifying the Form N-426, the Army is certifying that the enlistees served honorably on active duty or in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve during a designated period of hostilities such that the enlistees could apply for military naturalization underINA 329.

Certain applicants who enlisted in the U.S. Army, including the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve Delayed Training Program (DTP) or Regular Army Delayed Entry Program (DEP), through the MAVNI pilot program on or before September 30, 2017, may receive a certifiedForm N-426under the terms of the Calixto Agreement. Such applicants become eligible to apply for naturalization underINA 329as a result of the certified Form N-426, even before attending initial entry training.

Under the Calixto Agreement,[44]if the applicant was not discharged as of September 22, 2022 or had received an uncharacterized discharge[45]from the U.S. Army by that date, the Army considers the applicant to have served honorably and certifies aForm N-426on their behalf even if they did not attend initial entry training.

Applicants are required to submit a certifiedForm N-426signed by a person authorized by the U.S. Army to certify the form. Applicants may also provide a copy of the September 22, 2022, Calixto Agreement with their naturalization application and with their certified Form N-426 as a substitute for identifying the type and duration of service in the Form N-426, and as evidence of honorable service or an under honorable conditions discharge.[46]Including the agreement and annotating on the Application for Naturalization (Form N-400) and Form N-426 with "Calixto" at the top helps USCIS identify class members and provide for more efficient processing.[47]

H3: 2. General Eligibility Requirements

Eligible Candidates

To be eligible for the MAVNI program, then-DOD required aliens to be in one of the following immigration categories or authorized stays at the time of enlistment into the U.S. armed forces:

- Asylee;

- Refugee;

- Beneficiary of Temporary Protected Status (TPS);

- Person granted deferred action by USCIS under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy; or

- Nonimmigrant in any of the following categories: E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, TC, TD, TN, U, or V.

Valid Status for 2 Years

Then-DOD required most aliens for MAVNI to have been in a valid status in one of the eligible immigration categories or authorized stays listed above for at least 2 years immediately preceding the date of enlistment. The alien was not required to be in the same qualifying category or authorized stay listed above for those 2 years on the date of enlistment.

Then-DOD exempted or waived the 2-year requirement for certain aliens. Specifically, then-DOD did not require DACA recipients to meet the 2-year requirement. In addition, then-DOD considered waiving the requirement that an alien applying to the MAVNI program be in valid immigration status or within a period of authorized stay at the time of enlistment on a case-by-case basis under certain circumstances.

H3: 3. Other Factors to Consider

Nonimmigrants and Absences from United States

Under then-DOD guidance, most applicants to the MAVNI program under a qualifying nonimmigrant category at the time of enlistment must not have been absent from the United States for more than 90 days during the 2-year period immediately preceding the date of enlistment. Then-DOD did not apply this 90-day limitation on absences to DACA recipients.

Foreign Residency Requirement

A nonimmigrant exchange visitor under the J nonimmigrant visa classification may have been eligible to apply for the MAVNI program with then-DOD. Certain nonimmigrant exchange visitors were subject to a statutory foreign residence requirement.[48]J exchange visitors who enlisted in the military through the MAVNI program were not required to comply with the foreign residence requirement in order to naturalize.[49]In addition, the dependent spouse or child of the exchange visitor was not required to comply with the foreign residence requirement.[50]

Adjustment of Status Applicants

Then-DOD did not disqualify otherwise eligible applicants to the MAVNI program by virtue of having a pending adjustment of status application with USCIS.[51]

H2: I. Veterans Residing Outside the United States

Admission or Parole into United States for Naturalization Interview

Aliens who reside outside the United States and have separated from the military are required to appear for an interview in the United States.[52]All aliens must be inspected and admitted or paroled in order to enter the United States.[53]

If seeking parole into the United States, the alien may file the naturalization application concurrently with an Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records (Form I-131) without a fee to seek an advance parole document for a humanitarian or significant public benefit parole before entering the United States, if necessary.[54]USCIS coordinates with the alien to schedule an interview date and location.

Documentation

An alien who is concurrently seeking naturalization and an advance parole document must provide all the required documentation to establish eligibility for naturalization with Application for Naturalization (Form N-400),[55]including a police clearance from every place of residence outside the United States within 1 year of filing the naturalization application. In addition, the alien is required to provide documentation to establish eligibility for an advance parole document with Form I-131, including submitting an Affidavit of Support (Form I-134).[56]

USCIS will inform the alien if they need to submit biometrics in connection with the naturalization application at an authorized site such as a U.S. embassy, U.S. consulate, or U.S. military installation.

In addition, the alien submitting Form I-131[57]is required to provide documentation to establish eligibility for an advance parole document.

Failure to Appear at Interview

USCIS considers the alien to have abandoned his or her application and administratively closes the application in cases where the alien:

- Fails to appear at his or her scheduled naturalization interview; and

- Fails to notify USCIS of the reason for nonappearance within 30 days of the scheduled interview.

USCIS considers subsequent correspondence from an alien within 1 year of the administrative closure a request to reopen the application.[58]

Jurisdiction

The USCIS office having jurisdiction over the alien’s last residence within the United States or Outlying Possession (OLP) maintains jurisdiction over the naturalization application.[59]If there is no evidence in the application to establish the alien’s last place of residence in the United States or OLP, the field office should review the service record for the address of record at the time of departure.

If the alien requests to have the naturalization interview conducted at a USCIS office other than the office having jurisdiction based on the applicant’s last residence, the office having jurisdiction may coordinate, if practicable, with the appropriate office to accommodate the request. Even if such a request for an interview is approved, the original office retains jurisdiction over the adjudication of the naturalization application.

Additionally, in certain cases that involved aliens recruited through the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program, USCIS required then-DOD background and security checks to be completed and a review of any derogatory information then-DOD obtained regarding an alien applying for naturalization. USCIS does not require any DOW adjudication of the alien’s suitability for military service, including a Military Service Suitability Recommendation or a Military Service Suitability Determination, to be complete before interviewing or beginning adjudication of a naturalization application, and the outcome of any such DOW adjudication does not determine the outcome of the naturalization adjudication.

[^ 45]The August 1, 2024, changes to the Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) struck prior language that an entry-level separation of a service member will be treated as “the required characterization” for “administrative matters.” This change prompted a change in USCIS policy, only allowing for a separation discharge of “honorable” or “General-Under Honorable Conditions,” to meet the threshold for “under honorable conditions.” These changes do not affect Calixto class members who receive an uncharacterized discharge and meet all other requirements.

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
