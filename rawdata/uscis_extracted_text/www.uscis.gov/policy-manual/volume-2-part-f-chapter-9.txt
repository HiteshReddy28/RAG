H2: A. Accompanying the Student

An F-1 student’s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 who are accompanying the F-1 student in the United States are eligible for admission in F-2 status as dependent family members.[1]An M-1 student’s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 who are accompanying are eligible for admission in M-2 status.

At the time they seek admission, the dependent family members of a student with a Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (Form I-20) must each present an original Form I-20 issued in the name of each F-2 or M-2 dependent and issued by a school certified by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) to admit F or M students.

H2: B. Following to Join the Student

An F-1 student’s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 who are following to join the F-1 student in the United States are eligible for admission in F-2 status as dependent family members if they are able to demonstrate that the F-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or is engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies.

At the time they seek admission, the dependent family members of an F-1 student must individually present an originalForm I-20issued in the name of each F-2 dependent and issued by a school certified by ICE SEVP for attendance by F-1 students. A new Form I-20 is required for a dependent family member where there has been any substantive change in the F-1 student’s current information.

An M-1 student’s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 who are following to join the M-1 student in the United States are eligible for admission in M-2 status if they are able to demonstrate that the M-1 student has been admitted and is, or will be within 30 days, enrolled in a full course of study, or is engaged in approved practical training following completion of studies.

At the time they seek admission, the dependent family members of an M-1 student must individually present an originalForm I-20issued in the name of each M-2 dependent and issued by a school certified by ICE SEVP for attendance by M-1 students. A new Form I-20 is required for a dependent where there has been any substantive change in the M-1 student’s current information.

H2: C. Employment and Study

F-2 and M-2 dependents are not authorized to work in the United States. F-2 and M-2 nonimmigrants are permitted to attend elementary, middle, and high school on a full-time basis. F-2 and M-2 nonimmigrants are also permitted to engage in study that is avocational or recreational in nature, or less than full-time.[2]If a dependent wants to pursue a full course of study beyond the elementary, middle, or high school level, or beyond what is avocational or recreational, the dependent has the option to request a change of status to that of an F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant.

H2: D. Period of Stay

H3: 1. F-2 Dependents

F-2 dependents are generally admitted concurrently with the duration of status of the F-1 student. F-2 dependents are not required to seek an extension of stay as long as they were admitted for duration of status and the F-1 student maintains their student status.

F-2 dependents of an F-1 student who is unable to complete the student’s course of study by the program end date on theForm I-20do not need to apply for an extension of stay if they were admitted for duration of status. If the Designated School Official (DSO) grants an extension of stay for the F-1 student, the DSO updates the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) for both the F-1 student and their F-2 dependents.

H3: 2. M-2 Dependents

M-2 dependents are admitted for the fixed period of stay for which M-1 students are admitted.[3]If USCIS grants an extension to members of a family group, all members are granted the same period of time, with the shortest period of time granted to any member applying to all.

If USCIS grants an application for an extension, the M-1 student and the student’s M-2 dependent family members, if applicable, are given an extension of stay for the period of time necessary to complete the course of study, plus 30 days within which to depart from the United States. The period of stay may not exceed a total period of 1 year, or the date a dependent loses eligibility for M-2 status (for example, the date an M-2 child turns 21), whichever is less.

H2: E. Change of Status

Any spouse and minor children of the student who wish to change their status to F-2 dependent status must file their change of status (COS) application onForm I-539while their current nonimmigrant status is valid and unexpired. Officers must review the expiration date of the applicant’s nonimmigrant status as indicated on the applicant’s Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94) or other relevant documents to make this determination.

If USCIS denies the principal nonimmigrant’s COS application, officers must deny any dependent’s COS application.
