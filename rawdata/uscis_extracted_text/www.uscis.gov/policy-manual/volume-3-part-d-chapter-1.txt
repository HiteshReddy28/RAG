H2: A. Purpose

The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) amended the nation’s immigration laws and included a broad range of criminal, civil, and health-related provisions.[1]VAWA addressed the unique issues faced by victims of domestic violence and abuse and provided certain alien family members of abusive U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (LPRs) the ability to self-petition for immigrant classification without the abuser’s knowledge, consent, or participation in the immigration process. This allowed victims to seek both safety and independence from their abuser.

Spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens and spouses and children of LPRs may file a self-petition for immigrant classification with USCIS. An alien filing the self-petition is generally known as a VAWA self-petitioner.[2]If USCIS approves the self-petition, VAWA self-petitioners may then seek an immigrant visa from outside the United States or apply for adjustment of status inside the United States.[3]

H2: B. Background

Under the family-based immigration process, U.S. citizens and LPRs may petition for certain categories of relatives to immigrate to the United States. This process generally requires U.S. citizens and LPRs to first file a family-based petition with USCIS on behalf of their alien family member. If USCIS approves the petition, the family member is then eligible to apply for LPR status.

Because the family-based immigration process requires U.S. citizens and LPRs to petition for their alien family member, they have control over the petitioning process. Some U.S. citizens and LPRs use their control over this process as a tool to further abuse the alien, threatening to withhold or withdraw the petition in order to control, coerce, and intimidate their family members. This allows abusive U.S. citizens and LPRs to perpetuate their abuse, and their family members may be afraid to report them to law enforcement or leave the abusive situation, as they may be dependent on the U.S. citizen or LPR to obtain or maintain their immigration status.

With the passage of VAWA, Congress created a path for victims of domestic violence and abuse to independently petition for themselves, or self-petition, for immigrant classification. The purpose of the immigration amendments in VAWA was to give aliens who have been abused by their U.S. citizen or LPR relative the opportunity to independently seek immigrant classification without the abuser’s participation or knowledge. Allowing victims to self-petition means that they are no longer dependent on their abusive family member to obtain immigration status, thereby removing at least one barrier to ending the abuse.

Legislative History

VAWA was enacted into law as Section IV of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.[4]Since its passage in 1994, there have been three reauthorizations of the statute (in 2000, 2005, and 2013), all of which expanded and added new protections for VAWA self-petitioners.[5]

The table below provides a summary of key provisions related to self-petitions in VAWA and its subsequent reauthorizations.

3 USCIS-PM D-Part D - Violence Against Women Act

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
