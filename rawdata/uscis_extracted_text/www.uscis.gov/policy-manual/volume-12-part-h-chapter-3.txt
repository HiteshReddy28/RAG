H2: A. General Requirements for Acquisition of Citizenship at Birth

A person born in the United States who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States is a U.S. citizen at birth, to include a child born to a member of an Indian, Eskimo, Aleutian, or other aboriginal tribe.[1]

In general, a person born outside of the United States may acquire citizenship at birth if all of the following requirements are met at the time of the person’s birth:

- The person is a child[2]of a U.S. citizen parent(s);

- The U.S. citizen parent meets certain residence or physical presence requirements in the United States or an outlying possession before the person’s birth in accordance with the applicable provision;[3]and

- The person meets all other applicable requirements under eitherINA 301orINA 309.

Until the Act of October 10, 1978, persons who had acquired U.S. citizenship through birth outside of the United States to one U.S. citizen parent had to meet certain physical presence requirements to retain their citizenship. This legislation eliminated retention requirements for persons who were born after October 10, 1952. There may be cases where a person who was born before that date, and therefore subject to the retention requirements, may have failed to retain citizenship.[4]

An officer should determine whether a person acquired citizenship at birth by referring to the applicable statutory provisions and conditions that existed at the time of the person’s birth. These provisions have been modified extensively over the years.[5]In some cases, an officer may need to determine whether an applicant’s parent or grandparent acquired citizenship before the officer can determine whether the applicant acquired citizenship. Officers may request additional evidence needed to establish the U.S. citizenship of the applicant’s parent or grandparent. The following sections provide the current law.

H2: B. Child Born in Wedlock

USCIS must determine whether a child is born in wedlock[6]or out of wedlock at the time of birth in order to determine which citizenship provision is applicable.[7]

USCIS considers a child to be born in wedlock when the legal parents are married to one another at the time of the child’s birth and at least one of the legal parents has a genetic or gestational relationship to the child.

USCIS views post-birth formalization of the legal relationship between a parent and a child as establishing the relationship from the time of the child’s birth. This is because the relevant jurisdiction’s recognition of the legal relationship between the parent and child is based on the circumstances of the child’s conception and birth, including, for example, the existence of a valid surrogacy contract memorializing all parties’ understanding of parental rights pre-conception. This rule applies unless otherwise specified in the law of the relevant jurisdiction or in the applicable court order.

A child born outside the United States acquires U.S. citizenship at birth under INA 301 if at the time of the child’s birth:

- The person is a child[8]of a U.S. citizen parent(s);

- The child’s legal parents are married to each other and at least one legal parent is the genetic or gestational parent of that child at the time of the child’s birth; and

- The parent meets the residence or physical presence requirements under the applicable law and the child meets all other applicable requirements underINA 301.

The tables below provide examples of different relationships and whether USCIS considers the child to be born in or out of wedlock at the time of birth in each scenario.

Parent’s Residence and Physical Presence Requirements

Depending on the law applicable at the time, the U.S. citizen parent(s) also have residency or physical presence requirements in the United States to transmit citizenship to a child.[18]The following table provides the current requirements under INA 301 based on the parents' citizenship.

TABLE:
Parents' Citizenship Status | Residence or Physical Presence Requirement
Child of Two U.S. Citizen Parents | At least one parent had resided in the United States or one of its outlying possessions.
Child of a U.S. Citizen Parent and a U.S. national (but not citizen) of the United States | The U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of at least 1 year.
Child of a U.S. Citizen Parent and Alien Parent | The U.S. citizen parent was physically present in the United States for at least 5 years, including at least 2 years after 14 years of age.[19]

H2: C. Child Born Out of Wedlock

H3: 1. Child of U.S. Citizen Father

General Requirements for Fathers of Children Born Out of Wedlock

The general requirements for acquisition of citizenship at birth[20]for a child born in wedlock also apply to a child born out of wedlock[21]outside of the United States (or one of its outlying possessions) who claims citizenship through a U.S. citizen father. Specifically, the provisions apply in cases where:

- A blood relationship between the child and the father is established by clear and convincing evidence;

- The child’s father was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth;

- The child’s father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for the child until the child reaches 18 years of age; and

- One of the following criteria is met before the child reaches 18 years of age:The child is legitimated under the law of his or her residence or domicile;The father acknowledges in writing and under oath the paternity of the child; orThe paternity of the child is established by adjudication of a competent court.

- The child is legitimated under the law of his or her residence or domicile;

- The father acknowledges in writing and under oath the paternity of the child; or

- The paternity of the child is established by adjudication of a competent court.

- The child is legitimated under the law of his or her residence or domicile;

- The father acknowledges in writing and under oath the paternity of the child; or

- The paternity of the child is established by adjudication of a competent court.

In addition, the residence or physical presence requirements contained in the relevant paragraph ofINA 301continue to apply to children born out of wedlock, who are claiming citizenship through their fathers.

Written Agreement to Provide Financial Support

In order for a child born out of wedlock outside of the United States (or one of its outlying possessions) to acquire U.S. citizenship through his or her father, Congress included a requirement that the father agree in writing to provide financial support for the child until the child reaches the age of 18.[22]Congress included the language to prevent children from becoming public charges.[23]USCIS interprets the phrase in the statute “has agreed in writing to provide financial support”[24]to mean that there must be documentary evidence that supports a finding that the father accepted the legal obligation to support the child until the age of 18.

The written agreement of financial support may be dated at any time before the child’s 18th birthday. If the child is under the age of 18 at the time of filing an Application for Certificate of Citizenship, the father may provide the written agreement of financial support either concurrently with the filing of the application or prior to the adjudication of the application. USCIS may request the written agreement of financial support at the time of issuance of a Request for Evidence or at the time of an interview (unless the interview is waived).

Alternatively, if the applicant is already over the age of 18, he or she may meet the requirement if one or more documents support a finding that the father accepted his legal obligation to support the child. In such cases, the evidence must have existed (and have been finalized) prior to the child’s 18th birthday and must have met any applicable foreign law or U.S. law governing the child’s or father’s residence to establish acceptance of financial responsibility.[25]

In all cases, the applicant has the burden of proving the father has met any applicable requirements under the law to make an agreement to provide financial support. A written agreement of financial support is not required if the father died before the child’s 18th birthday.[26]

Written Agreement Requirements

In order for a document to qualify as a written agreement of financial support underINA 309(a)(3), the document:

- Must be in writing and acknowledged by the father;[27]

- Must indicate the father’s agreement to provide financial support for the child;[28]and

- Must be dated before the child’s 18th birthday.

In addition, USCIS considers whether the agreement was voluntary.

Other Acceptable Documentation

A written agreement of financial support may come in different forms and documents. USCIS may consider other similar documentation in which the father accepts financial responsibility of the child until the age of 18. Some examples of documents USCIS may consider include:

- A previously submitted Affidavit of Support (Form I-134) or Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864);

- Military Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) enrollment;

- Written voluntary acknowledgement of a child in a jurisdiction where there is a legal requirement that the father provide financial support;[29]

- Documentation establishing paternity by a court or administrative agency with jurisdiction over the child’s personal status, if accompanied by evidence from the record of proceeding establishing the father initiated the paternity proceeding and the jurisdiction legally requires the father to provide financial support; or

- A petition by the father seeking child custody or visitation with the court of jurisdiction with an agreement to provide financial support and the jurisdiction legally requires the father to provide financial support.

H3: 2. Child of U.S. Citizen Mother

The rules that determine whether a child born out of wedlock outside of the United States derives citizenship at birth from the U.S. citizen mother vary depending on when the child was born.

Child Born On or After December 23, 1952 and Before June 12, 2017

A child born between December 23, 1952 and June 12, 2017 who is born out of wedlock outside of the United States and its outlying possessions acquires citizenship at birth if:

- The person is a child[30]of a U.S. citizen parent(s);

- The child’s mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth; and

- The child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for 1 continuous year before the child’s birth.[31]

Child Born On or After June 12, 2017

A child born on or after June 12, 2017, who is born out of wedlock outside of the United States or one of its outlying possessions acquires citizenship at birth if:

- The person is a child[32]of a U.S. citizen parent(s);

- The child’s mother was a U.S. citizen at the time of the child’s birth; and​

- The child’s U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for at least 5 years before the child’s birth (at least 2 years of which were after age 14).[33]

Effect of Sessions v. Morales-Santana Decision

Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision inSessions v. Morales-Santana,[34]the physical presence requirements for children born out of wedlock were different for a child acquiring citizenship through a U.S. citizen mother than for those acquiring through a U.S. citizen father. An unwed U.S. citizen mother could transmit citizenship to her child if the mother was physically present in the United States for 1 continuous year prior to the child's birth.[35]An unwed U.S. citizen father, by contrast, was held to the longer physical presence requirement of 5 years (at least 2 years of which were after age 14) in the United States or one of its outlying possessions.[36]

On June 12, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court held, inSessions v. Morales-Santana, that the different physical presence requirements for an unwed U.S. citizen father and an unwed U.S. citizen mother violated the U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause.[37]The U.S. Supreme Court indicated that the 5 years of physical presence (at least 2 years of which were after age 14)[38]requirement should apply prospectively to all cases involving a child born out of wedlock outside the United States to one U.S. citizen parent and one alien parent, regardless of the sex of the parent.[39]

The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively eliminated, prospectively, the 1 year continuous physical presence requirement that previously applied to unwed U.S. citizen mothers, and replaced it with the higher physical presence requirement that previously applied to unwed U.S. citizen fathers.[40]AfterSessions v. Morales-Santana, the 1-year continuous physical presence requirement[41]remains in effect only for those children born prior to June 12, 2017 outside of the United States to unwed U.S. citizen mothers.

H3: 3. Child of Two U.S. Citizen Parents

For children born out of wedlock to two U.S. citizen parents, USCIS determines whether the child acquired citizenship from either parent individually. Once the child acquired from one of the parents, the child is a U.S. citizen, and the officer need not determine whether the child also acquired from the other U.S. citizen parent. Whether a child born out of wedlock outside the United States acquires citizenship at birth from two U.S. citizen parents depends on when the child was born.

Child Born Out of Wedlock On or After November 14, 1986[42]

A child born out of wedlock on or after November 14, 1986, is a U.S. citizen at birth, if:

- The person is the child[43]of two U.S. citizen parents;

- Both of the child’s parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child’s birth; and

- Either the U.S. citizen father meets the requirements to transmit citizenship underINA 309[44]or the U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous[45]period of 1 year before the child’s birth.[46]

H3: 4. Summary of Physical Presence Requirements for Parents of Children Born Out of Wedlock

The following table outlines the physical presence requirements under INA 309 based on the parents’ citizenship.

If the U.S. citizen mother does not meet the physical presence requirements, then the U.S. citizen father must satisfy all the requirements in INA 309(a), and at least one parent must have resided in the United States or OLP before the child was born.

H2: D. Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600)

H3: 1. Submission of Application

A person born outside the United States who acquires U.S. citizenship at birth is not required to have evidence of such status. However, if the person seeks documentation of U.S. citizenship status, the person may file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) with USCIS.[48]

The Secretary of Homeland Security has jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) within the United States, and the Secretary of State has jurisdiction over claims of U.S. citizenship made by persons who are abroad.[49]Therefore, generally, an Application for Certificate of Citizenship is submitted by persons who claim U.S. citizenship and are present within the United States. However, USCIS accepts a Form N-600 filed by a person who does not live in the United States, but USCIS does not adjudicate the application on the merits until the person is present in the United States in order to ensure that USCIS has jurisdiction over the application.[50]

A person who is at least 18 years of age may submit the Application for Certificate of Citizenship on their own behalf. A parent or a legal guardian may submit the application for a child who has not reached 18 years of age.

USCIS issues proof of U.S. citizenship in the form of a Certificate of Citizenship if the Application for Certificate of Citizenship is approved and the person takes the Oath of Allegiance, if required to do so.

USCIS does not mail Certificates of Citizenship outside the United States except when a military member is issued a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 320[51]or a military member’s dependent child naturalizes underINA 322(d).

H3: 2. U.S. Passport or Consular Report of Birth Abroad as Evidence of Citizenship

A person may also apply for a U.S. passport with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.[52]A parent or legal guardian of a U.S. citizen child born outside the United States may also apply to the local U.S. embassy or consulate for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA or Form FS-240).[53]A U.S. passport is valid for a limited time as established by DOS policies and standards on passport issuance.[54]Once a passport is expired, it is no longer conclusive evidence of citizenship.[55]Neither a CRBA nor a Certificate of Citizenship expires.

A valid, unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA serves as evidence of a person’s U.S. citizenship.[56]An applicant for a Certificate of Citizenship may submit a valid and unexpired U.S. passport or a CRBA as evidence of U.S. citizenship.[57]The officer must review the valid U.S. passport or CRBA and the documentation submitted with the application and contained in the record to determine if it was issued properly.

The officer approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship if the applicant is a U.S. citizen and meets all requirements.

H3: 3. Request to Revoke U.S. Passport or Cancel Consular Report of Birth Abroad

If the officer determines that the applicant is not a U.S. citizen or has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport or CRBA submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, the officer reviews the case with USCIS counsel. Then, if appropriate, the officer may request that DOS revoke the U.S. passport or cancel the CRBA.[58]

Only DOS has the authority to revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA.[59]DOS may revoke a U.S. passport or cancel a CRBA in cases where the passport or CRBA was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously.[60]

USCIS provides the following information to DOS in the passport revocation or CRBA cancellation request:

- The applicant’s complete biographic information, including name and any known aliases;

- The applicant’s last known address;

- All previous unexpired U.S. passport numbers and alien registration numbers (A-numbers);

- A copy of the CRBA or of the biographical page of the U.S. passport submitted as evidence (if available);

- An explanation for requesting revocation or cancellation, including reasons for the request, analysis of the facts and dates used in determining that the passport or CRBA should be revoked or cancelled, and evaluation of evidence indicating that the applicant did not acquire U.S. citizenship;

- Copies of all documentary evidence in support of the request, including certified translations of any documents written or originally prepared in a foreign language; and

- The contact information of the USCIS office making the request.

Adjudication of Application with a U.S. Passport Revocation or Cancellation Request

After reviewing the case on the merits and requesting a revocation of a U.S. passport or a cancellation of a CRBA from DOS, the officer generally may not complete the adjudication of the Application for Certificate of Citizenship until DOS responds.

If DOS notifies USCIS that it does not intend to revoke the passport or cancel the CRBA, USCIS approves the Application for Certificate of Citizenship.[61]However, in cases with unusual or complex circumstances, USCIS may further consult with DOS.

If USCIS has evidence indicating that a U.S. passport submitted as evidence was obtained or issued illegally, fraudulently, or erroneously, and the passport was valid at the time of filing, but is expired at the time of adjudication, the officer should review the case with USCIS counsel and DOS before adjudicating.[62]

If DOS revokes the U.S. passport or cancels the CRBA, the officer denies the application in cases where the applicant does not otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship.

H2: E. Citizenship Interview and Waiver

In general, an applicant must appear in person for an interview before a USCIS officer after filing an Application for Certificate of Citizenship. This includes the U.S. citizen parent or legal guardian if the application is filed on behalf of a child under 18 years of age.[63]USCIS, however, may waive the interview requirement if all the required documentation necessary to establish the applicant's eligibility is already included in USCIS administrative records, or if the application is accompanied by one of the following:

- Consular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240);

- Applicant’s unexpired U.S. passport issued initially for a full 5 or 10-year period; or

- Certificate of Naturalization of the applicant's parent or parents.[64]

H2: F. Decision and Oath of Allegiance

H3: 1. Approval of Application, Oath of Allegiance, and Waiver for Children under 14 Years of Age

If an officer approves theForm N-600, USCIS administers the Oath of Allegiance before issuing a Certificate of Citizenship.[65]

However, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) permits USCIS to waive the taking of the Oath of Allegiance if USCIS determines the person is unable to understand its meaning.[66]USCIS has determined that children under the age of 14 are generally unable to understand the meaning of the oath.

Accordingly, USCIS waives the oath requirement for a child younger than 14 years of age. If USCIS waives the oath requirement, USCIS issues a Certificate of Citizenship after the officer approves the application.

If an applicant does not take the Oath of Allegiance and is not eligible for a waiver, USCIS cannot issue a Certificate of Citizenship.[67]

H3: 2. Denial of Application

If an officer denies the Certificate of Citizenship application, the officer must notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for denial and include information on the right to appeal in the notice.[68]An applicant may file an appeal within 30 calendar days after service of the decision (33 days if the decision was mailed).

[^ 15]Persons using ART may use a gestational carrier who is a person who gestates, or carries, an embryo that was formed from the egg of another person on behalf of the intended parent or parents. The gestational carrier is genetically unrelated to the child and usually has a contractual obligation to return the infant to his or her intended legal parents. For additional information on ART, see theCenters for Disease Control (CDC) website. A non-genetic gestational parent who is not the legally recognized parent may not transmit U.S. citizenship to the child (for example, a gestational carrier who is not a legal parent). USCIS follows any applicable court judgment of the relevant jurisdiction if parentage is disputed. In addition, USCIS does not adjudicate cases involving children whose legal parentage remains in dispute unless there has been a final determination by a proper authority.

[^ 23]See the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1986,Pub. L. 99–653  (PDF)(November 14, 1986). The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) was intended to keep families together and generally construed in favor of family unity and the acceptance of responsibility by family members. SeeSolis-Espinoza v. Gonzales, 401 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2005).

[^ 24]SeeINA 309(a)(3).

[^ 25]In many cases, the issue of whether the father agreed to provide financial support depends on foreign law. The applicant bears the burden of proving the father has met any applicable requirements to make a binding agreement under the law. SeeMatter of Annang  (PDF), 14 I&N Dec. 502 (BIA 1973). Officers should consult USCIS counsel about any requirements under the law.

[^ 26]SeeINA 309.

[^ 27]A court document may be signed by a judge rather than the father, but may still serve as evidence to meet this requirement if there is an indication in the record of proceedings that the father consented to the determination of paternity.

[^ 28]Since the statute only provides for the agreement of the father to provide support and does not provide for any loss of citizenship if the agreement is not met, USCIS does not consider whether the father actually provided financial support.

[^ 29]For example, a birth certificate or acknowledgement document submitted and certified by the father. Under U.S. jurisdictions, a written voluntary acknowledgement of a child generally triggers a legal obligation to support the child. However, under foreign jurisdictions, a voluntary written agreement may not always trigger a legal obligation to support the child. The officer may consult with local USCIS counsel for questions regarding the effect of the law.

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].

Retention Requirements

- A child is relieved from the retention requirements if, prior to his or her 18th birthday, the child begins to reside permanently in the United States and the alien parent naturalizes.​

- The Act of October 10, 1978,Pub. L. 95-423   (PDF), repealed retention requirements prospectively only. Anyone born on or after October 11, 1952 (not age 26 on October 10, 1978) was no longer subject to retention requirements. Since the amending legislation was prospective only, it did not restore citizenship to anyone who, prior to its enactment, had lost citizenship for failing to meet the retention requirements.

[^ 1]A child must meet the definition of child under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). See Volume 12, Citizenship and Naturalization, Part H, Children of U.S. Citizens, Chapter 2, Definition of Child and Residence for Citizenship and Naturalization [12 USCIS-PM H.2]. A child born out of wedlock must be legitimated to derive U.S. citizenship from his or her father.

[^ 2]Child relieved of the remainder of the 5-year waiting period if the naturalized parent meets definition of “both parents.”

[^ 3]The definition of “both parents” includes:

- The surviving parent should the other parent die;

- The naturalized parent having legal custody in the case of a divorce; or

- The mother of a child born out of wedlock.

[^ 4]The definition of “both parents” as found in Section 313-14 of the Nationality Act of 1940,Pub. L. 76-853   (PDF), 54 Stat. 1145-46 (October 14, 1940) includes:

- The surviving parent should the other parent die;

- The naturalized parent having legal custody in the case of a divorce or a legal separation; or

- The alien parent who naturalizes when the other parent is already a U.S. citizen since the child’s birth.

[^ 5]Once the child was legitimated under the age of 16, both parents were required to naturalize.

[^ 6]In the Second Circuit (New York, Connecticut, and Vermont), and the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam, Hawaii, and Northern Mariana Islands), USCIS does not require that the child become an LPR before the age of 18, provided that the child shows some “objective official manifestation of permanent residence” in the United States while under age 18. SeeCheneau v. Garland(PDF), 997 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2021). SeeNwozuzu v. Holder, 726 F.3d 323 (2nd Cir. 2013). The courts have not defined “objective official manifestation of permanent residence,” but it includes situations where a child is physically residing in the United States, intends to reside in the United States permanently,andhas taken some official action to accomplish that (such as applying for lawful permanent residence with USCIS). For questions about which other circumstances may qualify as an “objective official manifestation of permanent residence,” officers should contact the Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC).

[^ 7]The definition of “both parents” as found in former INA 321 and former INA 320,Pub. L 82-414   (PDF), 66 Stat. 163, 245 (June 27, 1952) includes:

- The surviving parent should the other parent die;

- The naturalized parent having legal custody in the case of a divorce or a legal separation;

- The mother of a child born out of wedlock, as long as the child had not been legitimated (if a child was properly legitimated under the age of 16, the law required both parents to naturalize); or

- The alien parent who naturalizes when the other parent is already a U.S. citizen since the child’s birth.

[^ 8]Adopted children may still derive from their biological parents if all other requirements are met, provided that the child’s adoption did not terminate the parental relationship with the naturalized parent or parents. For example, a child who was born out of wedlock to alien parents may still derive citizenship from the mother in cases where:

- Paternity was not established by legitimation;

- The child was adopted by the stepfather; and

- The child’s biological mother naturalized.

This is because the adoption did not alter the child’s legal relationship with the mother.

[^ 9]In the Second Circuit (New York, Connecticut, and Vermont), and the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam, Hawaii, and Northern Mariana Islands), USCIS does not require that the child become an LPR before the age of 18, provided that the child shows some “objective official manifestation of permanent residence” in the United States while under age 18.SeeCheneau v. Garland(PDF), 997 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2021). SeeNwozuzu v. Holder, 726 F.3d 323 (2nd Cir. 2013).

[^ 10]The definition of “both parents” as found in former INA 321,Pub. L 82-414   (PDF), 66 Stat. 163, 245 (June 27, 1952) includes:

- The surviving parent should the other parent die;

- The naturalized parent having legal custody in the case of a divorce or a legal separation; or

- The mother of a child born out of wedlock, as long as the child had not been legitimated (if a child was properly legitimated under the age of 16, the law required both parents to naturalize).

The definition of “both parents” as found in former INA 320,Pub. L 82-414   (PDF), 66 Stat. 163, 245 (June 27, 1952) includes:

- The alien parent who naturalizes when the other parent is already a U.S. citizen since the child’s birth.

- In the case of a child with one adoptive parent and one natural parent, the adoptive parent must naturalize. The adoptive parent may not be a native-born U.S. citizen.

[^ 11]An adopted child must be residing in the United States, with lawful admission, in the custody of the adoptive parent(s) at the time of the parent’s naturalization, meet all the requirements for adopted children inINA 101(b)(1), and be adopted by a certain age depending on the period of last action. For more information, see Volume 5, Adoptions, Part F, Citizenship for Adopted Children, Appendix: How Previous Citizenship Provisions Apply to Adopted Children [5 USCIS-PM F, Appendices Tab].

[^ 12]On or after March 26, 2020, a child who is residing outside the United States may be considered to be residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent if all of the following requirements are met:

- The child is in the legal and physical custody of a U.S. citizen parent who is:Stationed and residing outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces;Stationed and residing outside of the United States as an employee of the U.S. government; orThe spouse residing outside the United States in marital union with a U.S. armed forces member or U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States.

- In cases involving the child of a U.S. armed forces member, the child is authorized to accompany and reside with the U.S. armed forces member as provided by the member’s official orders.

- In cases involving the child of a spouse of a U.S. armed forces member, the child and the spouse are both authorized to accompany and reside with the U.S. armed forces member as provided by the member’s official orders.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of 1952,Pub. L. 82-414         (PDF)(June 27, 1952), Congress has provided for the naturalization of a child under age 18 upon petition by the U.S. citizen parent. SeeINA 322. The requirements varied with different amendments, but naturalization under this provision always required an application or petition by the parent; citizenship was not automatic.
