H1: Chapter 8 - Waivers of Inadmissibility Based on Public Charge Ground

- Guidance

- Resources (68)

- Appendices (5)

- Updates (12)

The availability of a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility depends on the immigration benefit the applicant is seeking.

H2: A. Immigrant Waivers

In general, the public charge ground of inadmissibility cannot be waived for aliens seeking lawful permanent resident (LPR) status. However, the following aliens seeking LPR status may overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility if they apply for and USCIS grants a waiver of the public charge ground of inadmissibility:

- Applicants seeking adjustment of status on account of their witness or informant status.[1]

- Certain aged, blind, or disabled applicants for adjustment of status under the legalization program.[2]

H2: B. Nonimmigrant Waivers

The following nonimmigrants seeking admission may overcome the public charge ground of inadmissibility if the alien applies for and is granted a waiver of the public charge ground of inadmissibility:

- Nonimmigrants seeking admission to the United States – An alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa or seeking temporary admission as a nonimmigrant may seek a temporary waiver of inadmissibility.[3]This application for a temporary waiver of inadmissibility is adjudicated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of either an alien’s application for admission at a port of entry or an alien’s application for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy.[4]If granted, the waiver generally only applies to the nonimmigrant classification for which it was granted.

- Applicants for admission as nonimmigrant witnesses or informants (S nonimmigrants)[5]– The application to seek nonimmigrant status as a witness or informant, including the request for a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility, is made on the Inter-Agency Alien Witness and Informant Record (Form I-854A). The waiver is discretionary, and USCIS may grant the waiver if it considers it to be in the national interest to do so.

The 1999 Interim Field Guidance is the policy that was in place before the 2019 Public Charge Final Rule was implemented. The 2019 Public Charge Final Rule is no longer in effect.
