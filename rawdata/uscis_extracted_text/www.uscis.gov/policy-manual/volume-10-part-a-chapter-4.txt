H2: A. General

Once USCIS accepts the Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765), USCIS reviews the application for completeness and submission of the required initial evidence.[1]In reviewing the Form I-765, USCIS ensures that the fee was paid, a fee waiver was granted, or a fee exemption applies. USCIS also reviews the application to determine the applicant’s identity, current immigration status, and employment authorization eligibility category.

If an alien fails to specify the employment authorization eligibility category on the application, USCIS reviews the file to determine the proper category. If USCIS is unable to determine the category, USCIS may issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) to provide the applicant the opportunity to specify the proper category.

If the alien is eligible for employment authorization, which may include, if applicable, meriting a favorable exercise of discretion USCIS approves the application and issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) on Form I-766.

In applicable cases, USCIS considers factors involving circumstances where an alien has endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused the views of an anti-American or terrorist organization or group, including those who support or promote antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, and antisemitic ideologies, to be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any applicable case involving USCIS discretionary analysis. Accordingly, USCIS enforces all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, including the use of discretion, to deny the benefit request involving such cases.[2]

H2: B. Determining Identity and Eligibility

There are two elements common to all eligibility categories that USCIS must consider when adjudicating Form I-765: identity and eligibility verification. Additionally, applications filed under8 CFR 274a.12(c), with limited exceptions, are considered in the exercise of discretion.[3]

H3: 1. Identity Verification

To grant employment authorization, and issue an EAD, or both, USCIS must verify the applicant’s identity. USCIS may therefore require an applicant to appear at a USCIS Application Support Center to provide biometrics.[4]

H3: 2. Eligibility Verification

USCIS must verify that the applicant meets the requirements of one of the categories eligible for employment authorization, an EAD, or both and has submitted evidence establishing eligibility.[5]The specific type of evidence varies by eligibility category. In general, supporting evidence to establish eligibility includes, but is not limited to:

- Visa(s) issued to applicant;

- Arrival-Departure Record (Form I-94);[6]

- Documents to establish a qualifying relationship; and

- Documents that establish a qualifying pending or approved application, such as a Notice of Action (Form I-797).

Generally, USCIS issues written notices in the form of an RFE or Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) to request missing initial[7]or additional evidence.[8]

H2: C. Decision

H3: 1. Approval

Once USCIS determines the applicant has established identity and eligibility for employment authorization including, if applicable, warranting a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS approves Form I-765 and orders production of the EAD.[9]

The approval of Form I-765 does not grant the applicant an immigration status; it simply provides authorization to work and accompanying evidence of such authorization, or evidence of authorization to work where an alien is already authorized to work by virtue of the applicant’s immigration status or circumstance.

Validity Period

Employment authorization and EAD validity periods are generally determined based on the eligibility category that is granted. USCIS determines validity periods as established by regulations, policy, or Federal Register Notices. When requests for employment authorization, an EAD, or both are based upon an underlying period of admission or status, the validity period generally coincides with that authorized period of admission or status. When USCIS calculates the validity dates based on a set number of years, USCIS issues the EAD with the length of time allowed, minus 1 day.

The below charts illustrate the maximum validity period that may be granted for requests for initial employment authorization, EAD, or both and requests to renew employment authorization, EAD, or both. For employment authorization incident to status, the validity period is assigned to the document issued evidencing an alien’s authorization to work in the United States and does not limit the period of employment authorization while the alien maintains status.[10]

8 CFR 274a.12

USCIS considers various factors when establishing validity periods for EADs, including the validity period of the underlying immigration status or circumstance, anticipated adjudication timeframes for pending immigration benefits, and the periodic need to reevaluate eligibility for employment authorization, EAD, or both, and to ensure that such aliens continue to pose no known security risk to the United States.

The validity date of the initial EAD begins on the date of approval. Generally, the same applies to Form I-765 renewal requests.

Validity Period for Replacements

USCIS approves a replacement EAD for the same validity dates and category as the original EAD.

Validity Period for Age Outs

For certain categories[64]where the applicant is a dependent child and will reach the age of 21 during the established validity period, USCIS provides an EAD expiration date that is the day before the applicant’s 21st birthday.

H3: 2. Denial

If USCIS cannot verify the applicant’s identity, the applicant fails to establish eligibility (including, if applicable, failing to warrant a favorable exercise of discretion) or abandons the application, USCIS denies the application. When USCIS denies Form I-765, USCIS notifies the applicant in writing of the decision and the reasons for denial.[65]There is no appeal from a denial of a Form I-765. However, an applicant may submit a motion to reopen or reconsider.[66]Furthermore, denial of Form I-765 does not preclude the applicant from filing again if eligibility for employment authorization can be established.

H2: D. Early Filing

If an applicant files for a renewal EAD more than 180 days before the current EAD expires and USCIS approves such request, USCIS generally does not backdate or postdate the renewal EAD in relation to the current EAD’s validity period.

H2: E. Automatic Termination and Revocation on Notice

Employment authorization automatically terminates if the applicant is no longer eligible due to certain circumstances outlined in the regulations.[67]No further action or notice by USCIS is necessary in the case of automatic termination.[68]

A notice of intent to revoke (NOIR)[69]is necessary upon a determination that:

- The statement of material facts contained in the application was not true and correct;

- The applicant violated the terms and conditions of the approved application;

- The basis for the EAD is no longer valid;[70]or

- USCIS approved the application in error.

A response with countervailing evidence may be submitted within 15 days from the date of service of the NOIR.

H2: F. Withdrawing Application

An applicant may withdraw Form I-765 at any time before USCIS makes a final decision on the application.[71]Any request to withdraw must be made in writing to the USCIS office listed on the receipt notice for Form I-765. The applicant or an authorized representative with a properly filed Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative (Form G-28) must sign the withdrawal request.

H2: G. Motion to Reopen or Reconsider

An applicant may submit a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider by filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B) within 30 days of the denial (33 days if denial notice was mailed to the applicant). Motions to reopen or reconsider are typically adjudicated by the same office that adjudicated Form I-765. USCIS issues a written decision on a motion to reopen or reconsider.

An officer denies a motion if the applicant does not meet the motion requirements or has not submitted evidence to overcome the denial grounds. The written denial explains why the motion did not overcome the denial grounds.

An officer approves a motion and reopens the Form I-765 if the applicant meets the motion requirements and has submitted evidence to overcome all reasons for the original denial.[72]

If USCIS reopens the case, an officer may approve the Form I-765 or issue a new denial. In all cases where USCIS denies the application for reasons not contained in the original decision, USCIS first issues a NOID to provide the applicant with an opportunity to review and rebut the additional denial grounds.[73]

When USCIS reopens the case but ultimately denies the Form I-765, the 30-day period during which the applicant may file a new motion restarts.

H2: H. Effect of Motion or Appeal on Underlying Application or Petition

The applicant is eligible to apply for employment authorization in cases where the applicant’s eligibility for employment authorization is based on an underlying application so long as that application remains pending. Generally, in cases where USCIS denies the underlying application, the applicant remains eligible for employment authorization if the applicant timely appeals or submits a motion to reopen the decision, and the appeal or motion remains pending. If USCIS grants a motion to reopen or an appeal on the underlying application, the applicant is eligible for employment authorization if all other requirements are met.

If an applicant appeals an unfavorable decision from an application for relief from removal from the immigration judge (IJ) to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the application for relief from removal is considered pending. If the BIA sustains the IJ’s decision, however, the denial becomes administratively final, and the application may no longer serve as a basis for employment authorization.

H2: I. Automatic Extensions of Employment Authorization Documents

Aliens in certain employment eligibility categories who file Form I-765, to renew their EADs, may receive automatic extensions of their expiring EAD.[74]

[^ 46]Includes two types of applicants who may be eligible for employment authorization: an applicant who filed an Application for Suspension of Deportation or Special Rule Cancellation of Removal (Pursuant to Section 203 of Public Law 105-100 (NACARA) (Form I-881) and the application remains pending with the asylum office or with Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), and an applicant who filed an Application for Suspension of Deportation (Form EOIR-40), or Application for Cancellation of Removal and Adjustment of Status for Certain Nonpermanent Residents (Form EOIR-42B) directly with EOIR.

[^ 47]SeeINA 212(d)(5)(A). See8 CFR 212.5. However, DHS has decided as a matter of policy to provide the benefit of employment authorization incident to parole akin to what is normally accorded to refugees (as well as a no-fee initial and replacement of an initial Employment Authorization Document) to certain Afghan parolees and certain Ukrainian parolees so that they receive similar treatment as refugees, which aligns with the spirit of legislation that states that certain Afghan parolees and certain Ukrainian parolees “shall be eligible for . . . other benefits available to refugees . . . .” See Section 2502(b) of the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act,Pub. L. 117-43  (PDF), 135 Stat. 344, 377 (September 30, 2021), amended by Section 1501 of Division M of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023,Pub.

Consequently, individuals covered by these circumstances are employment authorized incident to parole. For more information on employment eligibility for aliens, see Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements [10 USCIS-PM A.2].

[^ 48]CNMI refers to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. This category includes a spouse of a long-term investor in the CNMI other than an E-2 CNMI investor who obtained such status based on a foreign retiree investment certificate. See8 CFR 214.2(e)(23).

[^ 49]Generally, the alien must establish an economic necessity for employment, see8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14). However, principal petitioners for U nonimmigrant status and their qualifying family members living in the United States do not need to submit proof of economic necessity to receive a bona fide determination EAD under category (c)(14) as there is a presumption of economic necessity.
