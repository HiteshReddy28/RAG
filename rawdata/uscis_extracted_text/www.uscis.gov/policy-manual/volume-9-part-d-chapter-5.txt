H2: A. Adjustment of Status and Immigrant Visa Applicants

In general, no waiver is available for adjustment of status and immigrant visa applicants who are found inadmissible because of drug abuse or drug addiction.[1]

H2: B. Remission

Although a waiver is unavailable for health-related inadmissibility due to drug abuse or addiction, an applicant may still overcome this inadmissibility if his or her drug abuse or addiction is found to be in remission. After being found inadmissible due to drug abuse or drug addiction, an applicant may undergo a re-examination at a later date at his or her own cost. If, upon re-examination, the civil surgeon or panel physician certifies, per the applicable HHS regulations and CDC’s Technical Instructions, that the applicant is in remission, the applicant is no longer inadmissible as a drug abuser or addict.

H2: Footnote

[^ 1]There are specific statutory provisions that permit USCIS to waive this ground, such as those applying to asylees and refugees seeking adjustment, and Legalization and SAW applicants. These waivers are specific to those classes of immigrants and are outside the scope of this chapter, which focuses only on waivers available underINA 212(g). See Volume 8, Admissibility, Part B, Health-Related Grounds of Inadmissibility [8 USCIS-PM B] for more information on inadmissibility on account of drug abuse or drug addiction.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
