H2: A. Overall Finding of Admissibility

The civil surgeon should properly complete the part addressing when the medical examinations and any follow-up examinations took place. The civil surgeon should also mark the appropriate boxes in the “Summary of Overall Findings” section.

If the summary indicates a Class A condition, the officer should ensure that the findings in the other form sections correspond. If they do correspond, the applicant is inadmissible. If there is conflicting information, the officer should return the form to the applicant for corrective action.

If the civil surgeon omits the summary finding entirely, the officer should check the findings in the other form sections to determine whether the applicant has a Class A condition. If all sections are properly completed, and no Class A condition has been indicated by the civil surgeon, the officer should not issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) and instead proceed with the adjudication.

If the officer is unable to determine whether the applicant has a Class A condition based on the other form sections, the officer should return the form to the applicant for corrective action. The RFE should be sent to the applicant directing him or her to return to the civil surgeon to correct the form.

H2: B. Changes to the Summary Findings

The Technical Instructions direct civil surgeons to treat Class A communicable diseases of public health significance or refer the applicant for treatment. Generally, the civil surgeon can only sign off upon completion of the treatment. This is why the officer may encounter a summary finding that has been reclassified from a “Class A condition” to a “Class B” or “No Class A or Class B” condition.

The officer should not reject the form because of the reclassification as long as the information is consistent with the information otherwise provided in the medical examination documentation. In such cases, the applicant is not inadmissible on health-related grounds.

For example, a civil surgeon may initially annotate the summary section with a Class A condition but, following treatment, change the annotation to a Class B condition. In this instance, the summary section may indicate an earlier Class A condition, followed by a later Class B determination. Since the civil surgeon indicated on the Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693) that a former Class A condition is now a Class B condition, the applicant is not inadmissible on health-related grounds.
