Adoptees do not qualify for automatic citizenship under the currentINA 320provisions if they were 18 years of age or older on February 27, 2001 (that is, were born on or before February 27, 1983). However, they may have obtained citizenship under a different law if their adoptive parent(s) were or became U.S. citizens. The law under which an adopted child may have obtained citizenship is the law that was in effect[1]while the adopted child was under the age of 18.[2]

Additionally, adoptees who did not obtain citizenship through their adoptive parents may obtain citizenship under a different law.[3]

Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (Before October 5, 1978)

Before October 5, 1978, there were no statutory provisions that provided for the automatic acquisition of citizenship by adopted children through their adoptive parents (unless the child was adopted by their biological father and the adoption legitimated the child). An adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship if the adoptive parents applied for naturalization on the adopted child’s behalf. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 323), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18.

Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (October 5, 1978 - February 27, 2001)[4]

Adoptive Parents Were U.S. Citizens at Time of Adoption

If the adoptive parents were both U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, there was no path for an adopted child to automatically derive citizenship through them.

The adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship through the child’s U.S. citizen adoptive parent(s), if the adoptive parent(s) applied for a Certificate of Naturalization or a Certificate of Citizenship on the adopted child’s behalf (under former INA 322). The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 322), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18 (unless waived).

Adoptive Parent(s) Naturalized After Adoption

If the adoptive parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, or one parent was a U.S. citizen and one was not, and the alien parent(s) later became naturalized U.S. citizens before the adopted child turned 18, the adopted child may have automatically derived citizenship. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 320 or 321). If the adopted child automatically derived citizenship under former INA 320 or 321, they may file  Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600), to seek documentation of their citizenship, or they may apply for a U.S. passport with the Department of State to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.

The following table provides an overview of how previous provisions for automatic derivation of citizenship apply to adopted children.

The child derived U.S. citizenship if the child was lawfully admitted as a permanent resident, was in the custody of the adoptive parents, and was residing in the United States at the time of naturalization of the adoptive parent(s), as described below:[11]

- One adoptive parent naturalized before the child turned 18 years old and the other parent was already a U.S. citizen on the date the child was born and never lost that citizenship;

- The surviving adoptive parent naturalized before the child turned 18 years old and the other died before the child turned 18;

- The adoptive parent having legal custody of the child, where there was a divorce or legal separation of the parents, naturalized before the child turned 18 years old; or

- Both adoptive parents naturalized before the child’s 18th birthday.
