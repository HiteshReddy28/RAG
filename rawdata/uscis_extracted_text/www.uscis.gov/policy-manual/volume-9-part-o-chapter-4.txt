H2: A. When to Consider INA 212(d)(3) Waiver

USCIS considers whether the applicant may be eligible for a discretionary waiver underINA 212(d)(3)[1]if the applicant is ineligible for a waiver under INA 212(d)(13), such as in the following circumstances:

- An applicant cannot establish that the conduct rendering the applicant inadmissible is connected to the trafficking; or

- The applicant is inadmissible under a ground not covered byINA 212(d)(13)but that is covered by INA 212(d)(3), which includes:Certain security and related grounds (INA 212(a)(3));[2]International child abduction(INA 212(a)(10)(C));[3]andFormer citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation (INA 212(a)(10)(E)).[4]

- Certain security and related grounds (INA 212(a)(3));[2]

- International child abduction(INA 212(a)(10)(C));[3]and

- Former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation (INA 212(a)(10)(E)).[4]

- Certain security and related grounds (INA 212(a)(3));[2]

- International child abduction(INA 212(a)(10)(C));[3]and

- Former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation (INA 212(a)(10)(E)).[4]

H2: B. Discretionary Analysis

The INA 212(d)(3) waiver analysis is a purely discretionary determination, and the analysis involves balancing social and humanitarian considerations against adverse factors.

In addition to considering a broad range of discretionary factors,[5]officers should also consider the following factors, as specifically outlined by the Board of Immigration Appeals, in determining whether to approve or deny an INA 212(d)(3) waiver:

- The risk of harm to society if the applicant is admitted;

- The seriousness of the applicant’s prior immigration law or criminal law violations, if any; and

- The reasons for wishing to enter the United States.[6]

In addition to these factors, officers should take into account as a positive factor that the applicant has suffered a severe form of human trafficking in persons and has complied with any reasonable law enforcement requests for assistance.
