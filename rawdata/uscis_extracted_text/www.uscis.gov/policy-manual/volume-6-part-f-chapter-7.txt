A total of 40,000 visas are available each fiscal year for employment-based 3rd preference workers, of which not more than 10,000 may be issued to “other” (unskilled)[1]workers. The visas for skilled workers (requiring at least 2 years training or experience)[2]and professionals (persons holding a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent in the specific field in which they are to be engaged)[3]are deducted from the same 30,000 number allotment.

A petitioning U.S. employer may file an Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers (Form I-140) on behalf of a beneficiary for classification as a skilled worker, professional, or other (unskilled) worker.[4]

H2: A. Eligibility

In all cases, the beneficiary must have the minimum education and work experience requirements that are specified on the permanent labor certification.[5]Therefore, if the permanent labor certification specifies that a bachelor’s degree in a given field is the minimum requirement for entry into the position, the beneficiary must possess a minimum of a U.S. bachelor’s degree or its foreign equivalent degree in the field.

Where the labor certification permits educational and experience equivalence to a bachelor’s degree, however, the beneficiary may qualify as a skilled worker if he or she meets the requirements on the labor certification.[6]On the other hand, if the permanent labor certification states a requirement of “2 years college and 2 years experience,” mere possession of a bachelor’s degree, without 2 years of experience, would not qualify, although it would meet the education requirement.

Sheepherders

A sheepherder is an unskilled worker. An alien sheepherder who has been legally employed as a nonimmigrant sheepherder in the United States for at least 33 of the preceding 36 months is not required to obtain an approved permanent labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor. Instead, the petitioner files the permanent labor certification application directly with the appropriate USCIS office or the U.S. Department of State. This procedure relates only to the permanent labor certification process and has no bearing on the amount of training or experience needed to perform the job.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
