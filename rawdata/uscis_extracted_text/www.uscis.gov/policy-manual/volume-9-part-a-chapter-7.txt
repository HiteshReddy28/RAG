An officer must specify the reason(s) for denying any waiver in the denial notice.[1]If an officer denies the waiver based on discretion, the officer should explain how the negative factors outweigh the positive factors.

If USCIS denies a waiver application, the governing regulation may provide that the applicant may appeal the denial.[2]The officer must specify in the decision letter if the applicant may:

- File an appeal. If the decision is appealable, the officer must give the applicant proper notice of the possibility to appeal; or

- File a motion to reopen or reconsider. If USCIS approves the motion, then the officer reviews the waiver application again as if it had never been adjudicated. Therefore, USCIS issues a new decision on the waiver application following a successful motion.

File an appeal. If the decision is appealable, the officer must give the applicant proper notice of the possibility to appeal; or

File a motion to reopen or reconsider. If USCIS approves the motion, then the officer reviews the waiver application again as if it had never been adjudicated. Therefore, USCIS issues a new decision on the waiver application following a successful motion.

USCIS may also reconsider a waiver approval or denial on its own motion at any time.[3]

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
