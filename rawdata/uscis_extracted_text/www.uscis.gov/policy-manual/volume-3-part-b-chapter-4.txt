H2: A. Overview

A victim who has applied for or been granted T nonimmigrant status (the “principal applicant”) may request derivative status for certain eligible family members. The principal applicant may file Supplement A, Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-914, Supplement A) concurrently with the principal applicant’s Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-914), at any time while the principal’s application is pending, or while the principal holds T-1 nonimmigrant status.

Eligible family members must be admissible to the United States or apply for a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility.[1]

There are two general categories of family members eligible for derivative T nonimmigrant status if accompanying, or following to join, the principal:

- Those whose eligibility is based on the age of, and their relationship to, the principal; and

- Those whose eligibility is based on a showing of a present danger of retaliation.[2]

H2: B. Derivative Status Based on Relationship to Principal

Where the principal T nonimmigrant (T-1) is under 21 years of age, the following table outlines which family members may be eligible for derivative T nonimmigrant status.[3]

TABLE:
Family Member | Code of Admission
Spouse | T-2
Child (unmarried and under 21 years of age)[4] | T-3
Parent | T-4
Unmarried sibling under 18 years of age | T-5

Where the principal is 21 years of age or older, the following table outlines which family members may be eligible for derivative T nonimmigrant status.[5]

Family Member | Code of Admission
Spouse | T-2
Child (unmarried and under 21 years of age)[6] | T-3

H2: C. Derivative Status Based on Fear of Retaliation

H3: 1. General Categories of Eligible Family Members

Regardless of the age of the principal, a principal T nonimmigrant’s family members may be eligible for derivative T nonimmigrant status if they are in present danger of retaliation as a result of the principal applicant’s escape from trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement.[7]The following table outlines which family members may be eligible on this basis.

TABLE:
Family Member | Code of Admission
Parent | T-4
Unmarried sibling under 18 years of age[8] | T-5
Adult or minor child of a derivative family member[9] | T-6

H3: 2. Adult or Minor Child of Derivative Family Member (T-6)

The T-6 category is unique in that it expands eligibility beyond relatives who are typically eligible for derivative status. To qualify for T-6 status, the applicant must establish:

- The familial relationship between the T-6 family member and the parent of the T-6;

- That USCIS granted the T-6 family member’s parent T-2, T-3, T-4, or T-5 status as the principal’s derivative beneficiary; and

- That the T-6 family member faces a present danger of retaliation as a result of the principal’s escape from trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement.

T-6 derivatives could include the principal’s grandchild, the principal’s spouse’s child (if not otherwise already eligible as the principal’s child), the principal’s sibling (if not otherwise already eligible, such as those over the age of 18 or married), and the principal’s niece or nephew. The adult or minor child can be of any age or marital status.

If the status of the T-1 principal or the T-2, T-3, T-4, or T-5 derivative was erroneously granted and subsequently revoked, or the T-2, T-3, T-4, or T-5 later becomes ineligible for derivative T nonimmigrant status (for example, a T-3 or T-5 derivative abroad married before admission to the United States), the T-6 applicant would not be eligible for T-6 nonimmigrant status or admission to the United States as a T-6 nonimmigrant.

The table below illustrates which family members of a principal T-1 nonimmigrant could derive T-6 status if they demonstrate they meet the present danger of retaliation requirement.

TABLE:
Age of the T-1 Principal | Derivative Family Member of the T-1 Principal[10] | Eligible T-6 Derivative
Under the age of 21 | Spouse (T-2) | The T-2 spouse’s child[11](the principal’s stepchild)
Unmarried child under age 21 (T-3) | The T-3 child’s child (the principal’s grandchild)
Parent (T-4) | The T-4’s child (the principal’s sibling)
Sibling (under the age of 18 and unmarried) (T-5) | The T-5 sibling’s child (the principal’s niece or nephew)
21 years of age or older | Spouse (T-2) | The T-2 spouse’s child (the principal’s stepchild)
Unmarried child under age 21 (T-3) | The T-3 child’s child (the principal’s grandchild)
Any age | Parent (T-4) based on present danger of retaliation | The T-4 parent’s child (the principal’s stepchild)
Sibling (under the age of 18 and unmarried) (T-5) based on present danger of retaliation | The T-5 sibling’s child (the principal’s niece or nephew)
Note: Where ages are listed in this table, they refer to age at the time of the principal applicant’s filing for T-1 nonimmigrant status. T-6 family members are eligible regardless of their marital status or age. There is no T derivative status for children (or other family members) of the adult or minor child who is granted T-6 status.

USCIS recognizes that this derivative family category is based on “a present danger of retaliation” and different family members may face a danger of retaliation at different times. The T-6’s family member does not have to hold derivative status at the time of the T-6 application.

For example, if the principal’s spouse held T-2 status but then died before the principal files for T-6 status for the spouse’s adult child, the adult child may still be eligible for T-6 status. Additionally, if a parent who had obtained T-4 status allowed that status to lapse without extending it, the T-4 parent’s adult or minor child could still be eligible for T-6 status if the child faced a present danger of retaliation.

H2: D. Family Relationship at Time of Filing

H3: 1. General Rule

Generally, subject to age-out protections and except as specified in subsections 2 through 4, the family relationship must exist at each of the following times:

- When the applicant files the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status;[12]

- When USCIS adjudicates the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status;

- When the applicant files the application for derivative T nonimmigrant status;

- When USCIS adjudicates the application for derivative T nonimmigrant status; and

- When the eligible family member is admitted to the United States, if residing abroad.

H3: 2. Spousal Relationship Must Exist When Principal’s Application is Adjudicated

USCIS evaluates whether the marriage creating the qualifying spousal relationship or stepchild and stepparent relationship exists at the time of adjudication of the principal’s application and thereafter.

Principal applicants who marry while their application is pending may fileForm I-914, Supplement Aon behalf of their spouse, even if the relationship did not exist at the time they filed their principal application.[13]Similarly, the principal applicant may file for a stepparent or stepchild if the qualifying relationship was created after they filed their principal application but before it was approved.[14]

H3: 3. Requirement to Be Unmarried

An eligible child seeking T-3 nonimmigrant status or eligible sibling seeking T-5 nonimmigrant status must be unmarried:

- When the principal files the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status;

- When USCIS adjudicates the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status;

- When the principal files an application on behalf of an eligible family member for derivative T-3 or T-5 nonimmigrant status;

- When USCIS adjudicates the application for derivative T-3 or T-5 nonimmigrant status; and

- When the family member is admitted to the United States, if residing abroad.

H3: 4. Exceptions to General Rule: Relationship and Age-Out Protections

There are certain protections available to family members whose age or relationship changes after the principal files an application for T nonimmigrant status.

Protection for New Child of a Principal Applicant

If the T-1 principal applicant had a child after filing the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status, the child is eligible to accompany or follow to join the T-1 principal applicant.[15]This includes becoming the parent of a child by means of a biological, step,[16]or adoptive relationship.

Age-Out Protection for Eligible Family Members of a Principal Applicant Under 21 Years of Age

For principal applicants who were under 21 years of age when they filed for T-1 nonimmigrant status, USCIS continues to consider a T-4 parent or T-5 unmarried sibling as eligible for derivative status even if the principal applicant turns 21 before USCIS adjudicates the T-1 application.

Unmarried siblings under 18 years of age at the time the principal filed the T-1 application remain eligible for T-5 status even if they turn 18 years of age before USCIS adjudicates the T-1 application, so long as the sibling is unmarried.[17]The derivative sibling does not “age out” even upon reaching age 18.

Age-Out Protection for Child of a Principal Applicant

USCIS continues to consider a T-3 child as an eligible family member so long as the child was under 21 years of age at the time the principal filed for T-1 nonimmigrant status. As long as the child is unmarried, the child remains eligible even if the child is over 21 years of age at the time of adjudication of the T-1 application.[18]The derivative T-3 does not “age out” even upon reaching age 21.

H3: E. Death of Qualifying Relative

USCIS may not approve derivative status for a surviving relative whose qualifying relative (the principal applicant) died before USCIS approved the derivative T application.[19]However, the unique structure of the T-6 classification may provide for continuing eligibility for the T-6 derivative even if the T-2, T-3, T-4, or T-5 derivative beneficiary dies before the principal files for T-6 status for the surviving relative.

For example, adult children who are married or over 21 years of age could potentially qualify for T-6 nonimmigrant status if they are the children of the T-1’s deceased spouse and meet the present danger of retaliation requirement.

However, in order for the spouse’s children (adult or minor) to be eligible for the T-6 category under this scenario, the principal’s spouse must have held T-2 nonimmigrant status through the principal T-1 nonimmigrant before the T-2 spouse died. If the principal’s spouse held T-2 status but then died before the principal filed for T-6 status for the spouse’s adult or minor child, the adult or minor child may still be eligible for T-6 status. However, if the T-1 principal’s spouse is deceased and never held T-2 status, then the spouse’s child would not be eligible for T-6 status.

[^ 9]The adult or minor child can be of any age or marital status. In enacting this new category of derivative beneficiaries in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013,Pub. L. 113-4  (PDF)(March 7, 2013), Congress used the term “adult or minor children,” which is not a term of art in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Under the INA, the term “son or daughter” means a child who is married or over the age of 21, while “child” means a child who is unmarried and under the age of 21. USCIS construes the meaning of the language “adult or minor children” to encompass both the INA definitions of “son or daughter” and “child.” Therefore, persons of any age and any marital status are “adult or minor children” and may be eligible for T-6 derivative status.

[^ 10]The derivative family members of the T-1 principal listed in this column can either currently hold T-2, T-3, T-4, or T-5 nonimmigrant status, have a pending application for such status that USCIS will approve before or with the application for the T-6 nonimmigrant, or have held such status in the past (with some exceptions).

[^ 11]This assumes the principal’s T-2 spouse’s child was not already eligible as a child T-3 derivative beneficiary. Stepchildren are included in the INA definition of a child so long as the parents married when the stepchild (spouse’s biological child) was under the age of 18. However, a biological child of the T-2 spouse whose marriage to the T-1 principal nonimmigrant occurred after the child turned 18 years of age is not eligible as a T-3 nonimmigrant, but the same child may be eligible for T-6 status.

[^ 12]See8 CFR 214.211(d)(1)as limited byMedina Tovar v. Zuchowski,982 F.3d 631 (9th Cir. 2020) (holding invalid the regulatory requirement that a spousal relationship exist at the time a Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-918) is filed in order for the spouse to be eligible for classification as a U-2 nonimmigrant). As a matter of policy, USCIS applies theMedina Tovardecision nationwide to spousal and stepparent-stepchild relationships arising in T visa and U visa adjudications. Therefore, where the family relationship is created by marriage, it does not have to exist at the time the applicant submits the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status. In that circumstance, the family relationship must exist at the four subsequent points set forth at8 CFR 214.211(d).

[^ 15]See8 CFR 214.211(e)(1).

[^ 16]An applicant can establish a T-3 stepparent and stepchild relationship if the applicant shows that the qualifying relationship was created before the stepchild turned 18, regardless of the adjudication outcome for an application for derivative T-2 nonimmigrant status (for example, the spousal relationship that created the stepparent and stepchild relationship), so long as the application for derivative T-2 nonimmigrant status was not denied due to failure to establish the claimed spousal relationship.

Debt bondage:

United States v. Farrell, 563 F.3d 364, 372-73 (8th Cir. 2009) (The workers’ relationship with their employers was more akin to one of debt bondage rather than simple debt. Given the continually mounting expenses, at no point was the value of the workers' labor sufficient to liquidate the debt and there was, in effect, no limit to the length of the services required to satisfy the obligation or even a limit on the amount owed.).

Compensation for labor:

United States v. Bradley                           (PDF), 390 F.3d 145, 153 (1st Cir. 2004), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 545 U.S. 1101 (2005).  (“If a person is compelled to labor against his will by any one of the means prohibited by the forced labor statute, such service is forced, even if he is paid or compensated for the work.”).

United States v. Marcus                           (PDF), 487 F.Supp.2d 289 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), vacated on other grounds, 538 F.3d 97 (2d Cir. 2008) (Enslavement can arise even if the initial participation in the labor was part of a consensual alternative sexual relationship.).

Duration of victimization:

United States v. Pipkins, 378 F.3d 1281, 1297 (11th Cir. 2004), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 544 U.S. 902 (2005), and opinion reinstated, 412 F.3d 1251 (11th Cir. 2005). (“Section 1584 requires that involuntary servitude be for ‘any term,’ which suggests that the temporal duration can be slight.”).

And that involuntary portion would suffice to sustain the conviction.”).

United States v. Dann                           (PDF), 652 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2001) (The charge of forced labor need not apply to the entire duration of the victim’s services or labor. It could be applied to only a portion of the time.).

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
