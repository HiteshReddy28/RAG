- Updates (6)

To deter fraud and enhance security, USCIS field offices generally collect expired Permanent Resident Cards (PRCs) encountered through the normal course of business, unless the PRC has an unexpired extension sticker or a valid receipt notice to be used with the expired PRC as evidence of continuing LPR status.

Offices that have collected expired cards should follow agency procedures to update applicable systems and destroy the expired cards.
