H2: A. Filing Requirements and Initial Review

An alien seeking to self-petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) must properly file a Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant (Form I-360) with supporting evidence in accordance with the Form I-360 instructions.[1]USCIS considers Form I-360 as properly filed if it is:

- Submitted on the current edition of the form;

- Filed at the correct filing location; and

- Properly signed.[2]

When initially reviewing the Form I-360, USCIS first determines whether the Form I-360 has been properly filed according to the above criteria. If the self-petition is not properly filed, USCIS rejects the filing and returns it to the self-petitioner.[3]If the self-petition is properly filed, USCIS sends the self-petitioner a receipt notice with a receipt, or filing date. There is no fee when Form I-360 is filed as a VAWA self-petition.[4]

Self-petitioning spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens may seek to adjust status as immediate relatives by filing an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) at any time, because visas are always immediately available for immediate relatives.[5]

If, however, the self-petitioner is a spouse or child of a lawful permanent resident (LPR) and seeking to adjust under a family-based preference category, the self-petitioner may need to wait for a visa to become available before filing a Form I-485.[6]

If a visa is immediately available, the self-petitioner may file the Form I-485:

- Together (or “concurrently”) with the Form I-360;

- While the Form I-360 is pending; or

- After the Form I-360 is approved (and remains valid).[7]

H3: 1. Priority Dates

The priority date is the date the self-petition is properly filed and is used in conjunction with the Department of StateVisa Bulletinto determine whether an immigrant visa is immediately available. For purposes of visa availability, a self-petitioner’s priority date is generally the date the self-petition was filed.

If self-petitioners were beneficiaries of a previously filed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) filed by the abusive qualifying relative, they may retain the priority date from the Form I-130.[8]The earlier priority date may be assigned without regard to the current validity of the visa petition. Officers may verify a claimed filing by searching USCIS electronic systems or other records.[9]

Note that derivative beneficiaries must be under 21 years old and unmarried at the time Form I-360 is filed to be included as derivative beneficiaries, even if they had a previously filed Form I-130 filed for them.[10]If derivative beneficiaries are eligible to be included on the Form I-360 at the time of filing, then they may retain the self-petitioner’s priority date from a previously filed Form I-130.[11]

H2: B. Documentation Requirements

Self-petitioners must file Form I-360 and submit documentation in accordance with the Form I-360 instructions to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they meet the eligibility requirements.[12]

While self-petitioners are encouraged to submit primary evidence, where available, USCIS must consider any credible evidence relevant to the self-petition.[13]The determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence is within the sole discretion of USCIS.[14]

Self-petitioners must submit evidence for each of the eligibility requirements.[15]Documentation should include:

- Evidence of the abusive relative’s U.S. citizenship or LPR status, such as a birth certificate, an unexpired U.S. passport, a Certificate of Naturalization, or a copy of a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551);[16]

- Evidence of a qualifying relationship that demonstrates a familial, legal relationship to the abuser, such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, and divorce decrees;[17]

- Evidence of having entered the marriage in good faith (for self-petitioning spouses only), such as insurance policies showing one spouse has been listed as the other spouse’s beneficiary; joint property leases, income tax forms, or accounts; or evidence of courtship, a wedding ceremony, shared residence, and other shared experiences;[18]

- Evidence of battery or extreme cruelty perpetrated by the U.S. citizen or LPR during the qualifying relationship (self-petitioning spouses may submit evidence of their child being subjected to battery or extreme cruelty), such as reports and affidavits from police, judges, other court officials, medical personnel, school officials, clergy, social workers, and other social service personnel; court or medical records; or protection orders;[19]

- Evidence of shared residence with the abusive U.S. citizen or LPR, such as leases, deeds, mortgages, or rental agreements listing the abuser and the self-petitioner; utility invoices, bank statements, or financial documents listing a common address; school records listing the parent and address of record; medical records; or income tax filings; and[20]

- Evidence of good moral character if the self-petitioner is 14 years old or older, such as affidavits and a local police clearance or state-issued criminal background check from each locality or state in or outside the United States where the self-petitioner has resided for 6 months or more during the 3-year period immediately preceding the filing of the self-petition.[21]

3 USCIS-PM D-Part D - Violence Against Women Act

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
