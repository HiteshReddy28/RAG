- Guidance

- Resources (9)

- Appendices (0)

- Updates (6)

Under certain circumstances, immigrants and nonimmigrants may still be considered as having been lawfully admitted even if the following errors occurred at the time of their admission:

- Entry was made and recorded under a name other than the immigrant’s or nonimmigrant's full true and correct name; or

- Entry record contains errors in sex, names of relatives, or names of foreign places of birth or residence.[1]

As long as the applicant proves by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the record of the claimed admission relates to him or herself, the admissions record can be corrected and the applicant considered lawfully admitted.[2]

If correcting an error in name that occurred as part of an entry on or after May 22, 1918, then the applicant must also establish that the name used was not adopted for the purpose of concealing identity when obtaining a passport or visa, or otherwise evading immigration law. Additionally, the name used at the time of entry must have been one the applicant was known by for a sufficient length of time before applying for a passport or visa so true identity could have been established.[3]

If the error took place during admission at a port of entry, the applicant should go to the nearest port of entry or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) deferred inspection office in person to correct the error.[4]If USCIS made an error on the Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94), the applicant should file an Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document (Form I-102) for correction.
