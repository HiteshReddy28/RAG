In general, the public charge ground of inadmissibility at Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)212(a)(4)applies to an applicant who is applying for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status.[1]An alien applying for a visa, admission, or adjustment of status must establish that they are not inadmissible under any ground of inadmissibility including the public charge ground.[2]If an alien is exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility, this ground of inadmissibility does not apply to them.[3]

H2: A. Applicants for Admission

The public charge ground of inadmissibility[4]generally applies to applicants for admission[5]as an immigrant[6]or a nonimmigrant unless they are specifically exempted by statute or regulations.[7]U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspects applicants for admission to the United States. When an applicant for admission demonstrates that they are admissible, the applicant may be permitted to enter the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant.[8]

H3: 1. Nonimmigrants

UnderINA 212(a)(4), any alien who is applying for a visa or for admission to the United States as a nonimmigrant is inadmissible if they are likely at any time to become a public charge. An alien applies directly to a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad for a nonimmigrant visa to travel to the United States temporarily for a limited purpose, such as to visit for business or tourism.[9]Department of State (DOS) consular officers assess whether the alien is inadmissible and therefore ineligible for a visa, including under the public charge ground of inadmissibility, as applicable.[10]Eligible aliens may also apply for admission as a nonimmigrant without a visa under, for example, the Visa Waiver Program (VWP).[11]

Once DOS issues the nonimmigrant visa, or the prospective traveler has obtained any required pre-travel authorization from CBP, the alien generally may travel to the United States using that visa or travel authorization, if applicable, and apply for admission at a port of entry. CBP then determines whether the applicant for admission is inadmissible under any ground, including public charge.

H3: 2. Immigrants

An alien who is abroad and is the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition may apply to DOS for an immigrant visa to allow them to travel to the United States and seek admission to the United States as an immigrant.[12]As part of the immigrant visa process, DOS determines whether the applicant is eligible for the visa, which includes a determination of whether the alien has demonstrated that they are not inadmissible under any of the applicable grounds inINA 212.

Once DOS issues the immigrant visa, the alien may travel to the United States and seek admission as an immigrant at a port of entry. CBP determines whether the applicant for admission as an immigrant is inadmissible under any ground, including public charge.[13]

H3: 3. Certain Lawful Permanent Residents Returning to the United States

Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) generally are not considered to be applicants for admission, and therefore are not subject to inadmissibility determinations upon their return from a trip abroad. However, in certain limited circumstances, an LPR is considered an applicant for admission and, therefore, subject to an inadmissibility determination upon the LPR’s return to the United States.[14]This inadmissibility determination includes whether the alien is inadmissible under the public charge ground of inadmissibility.

H2: B. Applicants for Adjustment of Status

The public charge ground of inadmissibility will generally apply to all applicants for adjustment of status unless they are specifically exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility.

- Any other categories of aliens exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility under any other law.[64]

H2: D. Categories of Aliens Exempt from the Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility Who Must Still Submit Form I-864

UnderINA 212(a)(4)(D), certain aliens applying to adjust status in an employment-based category are required to submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864). This includes aliens whose employment-based petition was filed by a relative of the alien[65]or by an entity in which the alien’s relative has a significant ownership interest.[66]

Congress did not include an exemption from this requirement for aliens applying to adjust status in the employment-based category, even for certain categories of aliens who are otherwise exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility.[67]

Therefore, if an alien in the following categories applies for adjustment of status based on an employment-based petition that requires a Form I-864, these applicants must submit a Form I-864 executed by their petitioning relative (or the relative with significant ownership interest in the petitioning entity):[68]

- Aliens who have a pending application that sets a prima facie case for eligibility for T nonimmigrant status;

- Aliens who have been granted T nonimmigrant status and are in valid T nonimmigrant status at the time the adjustment of status application is properly filed with USCIS and at the time the adjustment of status is adjudicated;

- Petitioners for U nonimmigrant status;

- Aliens who have been granted U nonimmigrant status and are in valid U nonimmigrant status at the time the adjustment of status application is properly filed with USCIS and at the time the adjustment of status is adjudicated;

- Self-petitioners under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA); and

- Certain aliens who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a family member in the United States.[69]

The 1999 Interim Field Guidance is the policy that was in place before the 2019 Public Charge Final Rule was implemented. The 2019 Public Charge Final Rule is no longer in effect. For more information about how USCIS is applying the public charge ground of inadmissibility, see thePublic Charge Resourceswebpage.
