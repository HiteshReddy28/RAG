In the United States

(INA 320 may also apply to certain children of U.S. military members, U.S. government employees, and their U.S. citizen spouses, who are residing outside of the United States)

A child born outside of the United States automatically becomes a U.S. citizen when all the following requirements have been met on or after February 27, 2001:

- The child has at least one adoptive parent who is a U.S. citizen by birth or through naturalization;

- The child is under 18 years of age;

- The child is a lawful permanent resident (LPR); and

- The child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent.[2]

Applies to certain children under 18 years of age residing outside of the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent.[3]

The child generally must be temporarily present in the United States after being lawfully admitted and be maintaining their status, amongst other requirements.[4]

The child must have an application filed on their behalf and take the Oath of Allegiance, unless waived.

H2: B. Child Residing in the United States

H3: 1. Eligibility

An adopted child born outside of the United States becomes a U.S. citizen by operation of law at the time the adopted child satisfies all requirements on or after February 27, 2001, and before turning 18 years of age.[5]These requirements include that the adopted child:[6]

- Satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children;[7]

- Has at least one adoptive parent who is a U.S. citizen (by birth or naturalization);

- Is an LPR;[8]and

- Resides in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen adoptive parent (or parents).[9]

Adopted children of U.S. armed forces members or U.S. government employees (or their spouses) who are residing outside the United States may also acquire citizenship underINA 320upon meeting the eligibility criteria.[10]

Children who meet all requirements ofINA 320(including having a final adoption)[11]at the time of their admission as LPRs automatically acquire citizenship upon their admission as LPRs. Children who do not meet all requirements of INA 320 upon their admission as LPRs do not acquire citizenship upon their admission, but may automatically acquire citizenship at a later point (provided they satisfy all conditions before they turn 18). This includes children who do not have an adoption considered final under U.S. immigration law and children who do not otherwise meet the requirements of INA 320 upon their admission. Their adoptive parents may need to take additional steps, such as obtaining a final adoption, before the child turns 18 years of age for the child to obtain U.S. citizenship through an adoptive parent.

H3: 2. Certificate of Citizenship

A person who automatically acquires U.S. citizenship is not required to file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600).

Certain adopted children automatically receive a Certificate of Citizenship without filingForm N-600. Other children immigrating based on adoption do not, and must submit Form N-600 if they seek to obtain a Certificate of Citizenship from USCIS. A person may also apply for a U.S. passport with the U.S. Department of State to serve as evidence of U.S. citizenship.

Certificate of Citizenship Issued without an Application

Generally, USCIS automatically issues a Certificate of Citizenship to adopted children who are admitted to the United States with an IR-3 visa[12]or IH-3 visa,[13]if the child meets allINA 320requirements.[14]In order to be issued a Certificate of Citizenship, if the child is over the age of 14, the child must take the Oath of Allegiance, unless otherwise waived.[15]

Thus, children over 14 at the time of their admission who are eligible for automatic issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship generally collect their Certificate of Citizenship at a USCIS field office after taking the oath. Children under 14 years of age who are eligible for automatic issuance of a Certificate of Citizenship generally receive their certificate by mail.[16]

Certificate of Citizenship with Application

USCIS does not automatically issue Certificates of Citizenship to adopted children who are admitted to the United States with a different visa classification (such as IR-2 visas) or who do not acquire citizenship upon their admission as LPRs (such as IR-4s[17]and IH-4s[18]).

If an adoptee did not automatically receive a Certificate of Citizenship and would like to obtain documentation of their citizenship status from USCIS, they (or their parent or legal guardian if the adoptee is under age 18) must submitForm N-600.[19]A person may also apply for a U.S. passport with the U.S. Department of State to serve as evidence of U.S. citizenship.[20]

An applicant (person seeking the Certificate of Citizenship) must submit, with their application, all required documentation and evidence in accordance with form instructions,[21]including a copy of the full, final adoption decree or order.[22]If the child did not have a foreign adoption that is considered full, final, and complete, the applicant must submit:

- Evidence of the final adoption decree or order; or

- If the U.S. jurisdiction of the adoptive parent’s or parents’ residence recognizes the foreign adoption decree or order as full and final, evidence establishing this under state law together with the foreign adoption order.[23]

To determine if the adopted child meets the requirements applicable to adopted children, USCIS reviews the file, including any evidence indicating that the child was admitted to the United States as an LPR through an adoption-based petition.[24]

In order to be issued a Certificate of Citizenship, if the child is over the age of 14, the child must take the Oath of Allegiance, unless otherwise waived.[25]

H2: C. Child Residing Outside of the United States

H3: 1. Eligibility

An adopted child who regularly resides outside of the United States[26]is eligible for naturalization underINA 322if all of the following conditions have been met before the child turns 18 years of age:[27]

- The child satisfies the requirements applicable to adopted children;[28]

- The child has at least one adoptive parent who is a U.S. citizen by birth or through naturalization;

- The child’s U.S. citizen adoptive parent or U.S. citizen grandparent has been physically present in the United States or an outlying possession for 5 years, at least 2 of which were after reaching the age of 14;[29]

- The child is residing outside of the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent, or of a person who does not object to the application if the U.S. citizen parent is deceased; and

- The child is lawfully admitted, physically present, and maintaining a lawful status in the United States at the time the application is approved and the time of naturalization.

Children of U.S. Armed Forces Members or U.S. Government Employees (or their Spouses)

Children are not eligible to naturalize underINA 322if they already acquired citizenship. Adopted children of U.S. armed forces members or U.S. government employees (or their spouses) who are residing outside the United States may acquire citizenship underINA 320upon meeting the eligibility criteria.[30]

H3: 2. Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate

To apply for a child to become a U.S. citizen and obtain a Certificate of Citizenship, the U.S. citizen parent, or if the citizen parent has died during the preceding 5 years, a citizen grandparent or citizen legal guardian, files an Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate Under Section 322 (Form N-600K) on behalf of the child.[31]

An applicant (person seeking a Certificate of Citizenship) must submit with their application all required documentation and evidence in accordance with form instructions.[32]The adoption-specific required evidence that applicants must submit depends on the type of case. The table below describes the adoption-specific evidence that is required by case type.

TABLE:
Type of Case | Adoption-Specific Required Evidence
Hague Convention Adoption Case | A copy of the full, final adoption decree or order; and a copy of the notice of approval of the Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative (Form I-800), and supporting documentation for the petition, or evidence the child has been admitted for lawful permanent residence on an IH-3 or IH-4 visa.[33]
Orphan Case | A copy of the full, final adoption decree or order; and a copy of the notice of approval of the Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative (Form I-600), and supporting documentation for the petition (except the home study), or evidence the child has been admitted for lawful permanent residence on an IR-3 or IR-4 visa.[34]
Family-based Adoption Petitions | A copy of the full, final adoption decree or order; and evidence that the child meets the requirements ofINA 101(b)(1)(E), including adoption before age 16 (or age 18 if the sibling exception applies) and 2 years of legal custody and joint residence with the adoptive parent.[35]

To determine if the adopted child meets the requirements applicable to adopted children, USCIS reviews the file, including any evidence indicating that an adoption-based petition was approved for the child, and has not been revoked.[36]

If an adoption-based petition was not approved for the child, the applicant must submit the following to show that they meet the requirements of a family-based adoption:[37]

- A full, final adoption decree or order showing that the child was adopted before the child’s 16th birthday (or before the child’s 18th birthday if the sibling exception applies);[38]

- Documentation that the child has been in the legal custody of the adoptive U.S. citizen parent for at least 2 years (at the time of filing); and

- Documentation that the child has been jointly residing with the adoptive parent(s) for at least 2 years (at the time of filing).

In order to be issued a Certificate of Citizenship, if the child is over the age of 14, the child must take the Oath of Allegiance, unless otherwise waived, before the age of 18.[39]

Adoptees do not qualify for automatic citizenship under the currentINA 320provisions if they were 18 years of age or older on February 27, 2001 (that is, were born on or before February 27, 1983). However, they may have obtained citizenship under a different law if their adoptive parent(s) were or became U.S. citizens. The law under which an adopted child may have obtained citizenship is the law that was in effect[1]while the adopted child was under the age of 18.[2]

Additionally, adoptees who did not obtain citizenship through their adoptive parents may obtain citizenship under a different law.[3]

Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (Before October 5, 1978)

Before October 5, 1978, there were no statutory provisions that provided for the automatic acquisition of citizenship by adopted children through their adoptive parents (unless the child was adopted by their biological father and the adoption legitimated the child). An adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship if the adoptive parents applied for naturalization on the adopted child’s behalf. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 323), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18.

Citizenship and Naturalization Laws (October 5, 1978 - February 27, 2001)[4]

Adoptive Parents Were U.S. Citizens at Time of Adoption

If the adoptive parents were both U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, there was no path for an adopted child to automatically derive citizenship through them.

The adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship through the child’s U.S. citizen adoptive parent(s), if the adoptive parent(s) applied for a Certificate of Naturalization or a Certificate of Citizenship on the adopted child’s behalf (under former INA 322). The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 322), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18 (unless waived).

Adoptive Parent(s) Naturalized After Adoption

If the adoptive parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, or one parent was a U.S. citizen and one was not, and the alien parent(s) later became naturalized U.S. citizens before the adopted child turned 18, the adopted child may have automatically derived citizenship. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 320 or 321). If the adopted child automatically derived citizenship under former INA 320 or 321, they may file  Application for Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600), to seek documentation of their citizenship, or they may apply for a U.S. passport with the Department of State to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.

The following table provides an overview of how previous provisions for automatic derivation of citizenship apply to adopted children.
