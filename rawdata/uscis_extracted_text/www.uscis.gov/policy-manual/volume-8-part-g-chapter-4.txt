H1: Chapter 4 - Prospective Determination Based on the Totality of the Circumstances

- Guidance

- Resources (68)

- Appendices (5)

- Updates (12)

The public charge inadmissibility determination is a prospective determination based on the totality of an applicant’s circumstances.[1]In making such a determination, USCIS reviews all information in the record.

The public charge inadmissibility determination is inherently subjective in nature given the express wording ofINA 212(a)(4)(A), which states that the public charge inadmissibility determination is “in the opinion of” DHS.[2]

The burden of proof to establish admissibility when seeking adjustment of status is always on the applicant.[3]The burden never shifts to the government during the adjudication process.[4]

H2: A. Prospective Determination

A public charge inadmissibility determination is based on an applicant’s likelihood at any time in the future to become a public charge,[5]that is, the likelihood of becoming primarily dependent on the government for subsistence as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.

H2: B. Factors USCIS Considers

Evaluating whether an applicant is likely at any time to become a public charge based on the totality of the applicant’s circumstances[6]means evaluating all the information provided on the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485), Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693), any other forms and evidence contained in the record, and statements by an applicant during an interview, if applicable. USCIS considers all information or evidence in the record that is relevant in the totality of the circumstances.[7]

For all applicants subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility,[8]the officer will consider the statutory minimum factors: age;[9]health;[10]family status;[11]assets, resources, and financial status;[12]and education and skills.[13]The officer will favorably consider a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864) (when required).[14]The officer will also consider any current or past receipt (or both) of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense by the applicant.[15]However, relatively few applicants will be both subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and eligible for public benefits prior to adjustment of status.[16]

There is no “bright-line” test in making a public charge inadmissibility determination. No one factor, other than the lack of a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, if required, can be the sole criterion for determining if an alien is likely at any time to become a public charge.[17]Instead, the officer must determine whether the applicant's circumstances, assessed in their totality, suggest that the applicant is more likely than not to become a public charge.[18]

H2: C. Empirical Analysis of the Best-Available Data

Under8 CFR 212.22(b), USCIS may periodically issue guidance to officers about how the factors under8 CFR 212.22(a)may inform the likelihood that an applicant will become a public charge at any time, based on an empirical analysis of the best-available data as appropriate.[19]

USCIS has reviewed the available data and currently anticipates that the best-available data may be found in theSurvey of Income and Program Participation(SIPP) from the U.S. Census Bureau, which is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of households that provides comprehensive information on the dynamics of income, employment, household composition, and government program participation. USCIS continues to analyze the SIPP data and other sources of data to consider how the best-available data can help inform this policy guidance as appropriate.

The regulation’s reference to empirical analysis does not contemplate individual officers conducting their own such analysis. The analysis of the best-available data mentioned in the regulation is performed at the agency level and is used to inform the Policy Manual content as appropriate.

USCIS will continue to analyze the data and may update the Policy Manual in the future as appropriate.

This guidance became effective December 23, 2022, and applies to adjustment of status applications postmarked (or filed electronically, if applicable) on or after that date.

8 USCIS-PM G-Part G - Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is issuing policy guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual to address the public charge ground of inadmissibility under section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as implemented by the Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility Final Rule,87 FR 55472                    (PDF)(Sep. 9, 2022).

The new final rule and policy guidance become effective December 23, 2022, and apply to adjustment of status applications postmarked (or filed electronically, if applicable) on or after that date. For applications postmarked (or submitted electronically, if applicable) before December 23, 2022, USCIS will continue to apply the public charge ground of inadmissibility consistent with the statute and the1999 Interim Field Guidance.

8 USCIS-PM G-Part G - Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility

USCIS is administering the public charge inadmissibility statute (section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) consistent with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance to determine whether a noncitizen is inadmissible as likely at any time to become a public charge. The 1999 Interim Field Guidance is the policy that was in place before the 2019 Public Charge Final Rule was implemented. The 2019 Public Charge Final Rule is no longer in effect. For more information about how USCIS is applying the public charge ground of inadmissibility, see thePublic Charge Resourceswebpage.

This technical update removes the guidance in Volume 2, Part A, Chapter 4, Volume 8, Part G, and Volume 12, Part D, Chapter 2 relating to the administration of the public charge ground of inadmissibility under theInadmissibility on Public Charge Groundsfinal rule, 84 FR 41292 (Aug. 14, 2019); as amended byInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds; Correction, 84 FR 52357 (Oct. 2, 2019) ( “Public Charge Final Rule”), which was implemented on Feb. 24, 2020. On Nov. 2, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide. On Nov. 3, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay and, on Nov. 19, 2020, a stay pending appeal of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ Nov. 2, 2020 decision. On Mar. 9, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit lifted its stay and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ order vacating the Public Charge Final Rule went into effect. USCIS immediately stopped applying the Public Charge Final Rule to all pending applications and petitions that would have been subject to the rule.
