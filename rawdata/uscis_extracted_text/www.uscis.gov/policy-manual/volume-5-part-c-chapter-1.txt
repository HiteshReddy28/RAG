H2: A. Purpose

In enacting legislation regarding orphans, Congress was primarily concerned with the welfare of the children. The orphan process is one of three different ways for a child to immigrate to the United States based on adoption.[1]The prospective adoptive parent (PAP) generally may pursue the orphan process[2]if:

- The child is not habitually resident in a Hague Adoption Convention Country;[3]and

- At least one of the PAPs is a U.S. citizen.

The orphan process involves a USCIS determination of the PAP’s suitability[4]and eligibility to adopt and a determination of the child’s eligibility to immigrate as an orphan.

H2: B. Background

The Displaced Persons Act of 1948 contained the first laws relating to the immigration of orphans. Since then, Congress has enacted several acts and amendments related to orphans and intercountry adoption. Significant recent changes include the:

- Intercountry Adoption Universal Accreditation Act of 2012 (UAA),[5]which requires that adoption service providers (ASPs) providing adoption services in orphan cases follow the same accreditation or approval process required of ASPs providing such services in Hague Adoption Convention cases; and

- Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 (CAA),[6]which changed the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) definition of an orphan so that only one adoptive parent in a married couple has to personally see and observe the orphan before or during the adoption proceedings in order for the adoption to be considered “full and final” for immigration purposes.[7]

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is publishing a volume in the USCIS Policy Manual regarding adoptions. This guidance incorporates basic requirements for the submission of adoption-based applications and petitions to USCIS.

5 USCIS-PM-Volume 5 - Adoptions

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
