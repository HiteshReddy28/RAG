H2: A. Purpose

USCIS accommodates naturalization applicants with disabilities by making modifications to the naturalization process.[1]USCIS aims to provide applicants with disabilities an equal opportunity to successfully complete the process. While USCIS is not required to make major modifications that would result in a fundamental change to the naturalization process or an undue burden for the agency, USCIS makes every effort to provide accommodations to naturalization applicants with disabilities.[2]

- USCIS evaluates disability accommodation requests on a case-by-case basis as accommodations vary according to the nature of the applicant’s disability. In determining what type of accommodation is necessary, USCIS gives primary consideration to the requests of the person with a disability.

- USCIS provides applicants with the requested accommodation or an effective alternative that addresses the unique needs of the applicant where appropriate.[3]

USCIS evaluates disability accommodation requests on a case-by-case basis as accommodations vary according to the nature of the applicant’s disability. In determining what type of accommodation is necessary, USCIS gives primary consideration to the requests of the person with a disability.

USCIS provides applicants with the requested accommodation or an effective alternative that addresses the unique needs of the applicant where appropriate.[3]

Applicants may request an accommodation at the time of filing their naturalization application or at any other time during the naturalization process.[4]

H2: B. Background

The Rehabilitation Act requires all federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities in the administration of their programs and benefits.[5]USCIS does not exclude persons with disabilities from its programs or activities based on their disability. The Rehabilitation Act and the implemented DHS regulations[6]require USCIS to provide accommodations that assist an applicant with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in its programs, to include the naturalization process.

H2: C. Difference between Accommodations and Waivers

Accommodations are different from statutory waivers or exceptions. For example, if an officer grants an applicant a waiver for a naturalization educational requirement, the applicant is exempt from meeting that educational requirement. An accommodation is a modification of an existing practice or procedure that will enable an applicant with a disability to participate in the naturalization process.

The accommodation does not exempt the applicant from the obligation to satisfy any applicable requirement for naturalization. The accommodation is a modification to the way in which the applicant may establish that he or she meets the requirement.[7]

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
