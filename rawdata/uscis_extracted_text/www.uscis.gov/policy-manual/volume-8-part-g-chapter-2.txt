Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)212(a)(4), an applicant for adjustment of status is inadmissible if, in the opinion of the immigration officer at the time of application for adjustment of status, they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.”[1]

H2: A. Likely at Any Time to Become a Public Charge

The INA does not define the phrase “likely at any time to become a public charge.”[2]

The regulations at8 CFR 212.21(a)define “likely at any time to become a public charge” to mean “likely at any time to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.”[3]

H2: B. Public Cash Assistance for Income Maintenance

For purposes of a public charge inadmissibility determination, “public cash assistance for income maintenance” means:

- Supplemental Security Income (SSI);

- Cash assistance for income maintenance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program; or

- State, tribal, territorial, or local cash benefit programs for income maintenance, commonly called “General Assistance.”[4]

H2: C. Long-term Institutionalization at Government Expense

For the purpose of a public charge inadmissibility determination, “long-term institutionalization at government expense” means government assistance for long-term institutionalization (in the case of Medicaid, limited to institutional services under Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act) received by a beneficiary, including in a nursing facility or mental health institution.

Long-term institutionalization at government expense is the only category of Medicaid-funded services (limited to institutional services under Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act) considered in a public charge inadmissibility determination.[5]

As part of the consideration of long-term institutionalization, USCIS considers both permanent institutionalization as well as institutionalization for a long period of time short of indefinite duration, in the totality of the circumstances.[6]However, long-term institutionalization does not include imprisonment for conviction of a crime or institutionalization for short periods for rehabilitation purposes.[7]

Long-term institutionalization does not include sporadic or intermittent periods of institutionalization, even on a recurring basis.[8]No other services paid for by Medicaid, including home and community-based services (HCBS), and no services provided under the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), are considered as long-term institutionalization at government expense.[9]

H2: D. Receipt (of Public Benefits)

USCIS determines an individual’s likelihood of becoming primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by the alien’s receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.[10]“Receipt (of public benefits)” only occurs when the applicant is listed as a beneficiary of the benefit.

USCIS does not consider public benefits received by the applicant’s relatives, including children, or received by the applicant solely on behalf of third parties. It is not considered receipt to apply for a public benefit on one’s own behalf or on behalf of another. Similarly, approval for future receipt of a public benefit on the alien’s own behalf or on behalf of another is also not considered receipt.[11]

H2: E. Government

DHS defines “government” for the purpose of implementing the public charge ground of inadmissibility as “any Federal, State, Tribal, territorial, or local government entity or entities of the United States.”[12]

H2: F. Household

For the purpose of a public charge inadmissibility determination, DHS states that an alien’s household includes:[13]

- The alien;

- The alien’s spouse, if physically residing with the alien;

- The alien’s parents, if physically residing with the alien;

- The alien’s unmarried siblings under 21 years of age, if physically residing with the alien;

- The alien’s children,[14]if physically residing with the alien;

- Any other individuals who are listed as dependents on the alien’s federal income tax return;[15]and

- Any other individuals who list the alien as a dependent on their federal income tax return.

USCIS is administering the public charge inadmissibility statute (section 212(a)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) consistent with the 1999 Interim Field Guidance to determine whether a noncitizen is inadmissible as likely at any time to become a public charge. The 1999 Interim Field Guidance is the policy that was in place before the 2019 Public Charge Final Rule was implemented. The 2019 Public Charge Final Rule is no longer in effect.

This technical update removes the guidance in Volume 2, Part A, Chapter 4, Volume 8, Part G, and Volume 12, Part D, Chapter 2 relating to the administration of the public charge ground of inadmissibility under theInadmissibility on Public Charge Groundsfinal rule, 84 FR 41292 (Aug. 14, 2019); as amended byInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds; Correction, 84 FR 52357 (Oct. 2, 2019) ( “Public Charge Final Rule”), which was implemented on Feb. 24, 2020. On Nov. 2, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide. On Nov. 3, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay and, on Nov. 19, 2020, a stay pending appeal of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ Nov. 2, 2020 decision. On Mar. 9, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit lifted its stay and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ order vacating the Public Charge Final Rule went into effect. USCIS immediately stopped applying the Public Charge Final Rule to all pending applications and petitions that would have been subject to the rule.
