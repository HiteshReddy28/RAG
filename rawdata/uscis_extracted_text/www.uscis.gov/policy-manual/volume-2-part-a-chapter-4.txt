H2: A. Extension of Stay or Change of Status

Generally, certain nonimmigrants present in the United States admitted for a specified period of time, or their petitioners, may request an extension of their admission period in order to continue to engage in those activities permitted under the nonimmigrant classification in which they were admitted.[1]

Also, certain nonimmigrants present in the United States or their petitioners may seek to change their status to another nonimmigrant classification if certain requirements are met.[2]

An alien seeking an extension of stay (EOS) or change of status (COS) generally files the request on a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) or Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-539),[3]depending upon the nonimmigrant classification the petitioner or applicant seeks to extend or change.[4]

The decision to grant or deny an extension of stay or change of status request involves an exercise of discretion by USCIS. There are a number of factors or factual circumstances that USCIS officers consider when conducting a discretionary analysis.[5]

Requirements to Timely File a Request to Extend Stay or Change Status

In general, USCIS does not approve an extension of stay or change of status for a person who failed to maintain the previously accorded status or where such status expired before the filing date of the application or petition.[6]USCIS, in its discretion, may excuse the failure to file before the period of authorized status expired where the requester demonstrates within the extension of stay or change of status request that:

- The delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the person’s control;

- The length of the delay was commensurate with the circumstances;

- The person has not otherwise violated their nonimmigrant status;

- The person remains a bona fide nonimmigrant; and

- The person is not the subject of removal proceedings and, in the case of extensions of stay, is also not the subject of deportation proceedings.[7]

In general, subject to its discretion, examples of what USCIS considers extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the person may include, but are not limited to:

- Where the person remained in the United States after the expiration of the period of admission due to a slowdown or stoppage of work involving a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute; or

- Where the primary reason for the late filing is the inability to obtain a certified labor condition application or temporary labor certification due to a lapse in government funding supporting those adjudications.

If USCIS approves an untimely filed application or petition to extend an applicant’s or beneficiary’s stay, the approval is effective as of the date of the expiration of the prior nonimmigrant admission period.[8]When USCIS approves a late filed application for a change of status, the change of status takes effect on the approval date. USCIS considers the applicant or beneficiary of an approved untimely change of status request to have maintained lawful status during the period USCIS excused.[9]

H2: B. Extension of Petition Validity

H3: 1. Significance of Prior USCIS Approvals and Deference

Deference to Previous Approvals

A request for an extension of petition validity, which is often submitted in conjunction with an EOS request, follows a previous finding of eligibility for the classification. Typically, these determinations are made by USCIS, although U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Department of State (DOS) also make these determinations. Although there is a previous finding of eligibility, the burden of proof in the request for an extension of petition validity remains on the petitioner.[10]

Officers are not bound to approve subsequent petitions or applications seeking immigration benefits where eligibility has not been demonstrated strictly because of a prior approval (which may have been erroneous).[11]USCIS decides each matter according to the evidence of record on a case-by-case basis.[12]However, deviation from a previous approval carries important consequences and implicates predictability and consistency concerns.

As such, any deviation requires close consideration of the previous approval by USCIS. When adjudicating a subsequent petition or application involving the same parties (for example, petitioner and beneficiary) and the same underlying facts, officers should defer to a prior determination that the beneficiary or applicant is eligible for the nonimmigrant classification sought, where appropriate.

Deviating from Previous Approvals

Officers should not defer to prior approvals in cases where:

- There was a material error involved with previous approval(s);

- There has been a material change in circumstances or eligibility requirements;[13]or

- There is new material information that adversely impacts the petitioner’s or beneficiary’s eligibility.[14]

An officer who determines that deference to a prior approval is not appropriate must acknowledge the previous approval(s) in the denial, Request for Evidence (RFE), or Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID). In addition, the officer must articulate the reason for not deferring to the previous determination (for example, due to a material error, change in circumstances, or new adverse material information). Officers must provide the petitioner or applicant an opportunity to respond to the new information.[15]

As mentioned above, an officer should not defer to a prior approval where new material information is available. This may include publicly available information that affects eligibility for a benefit. For example, an officer may be aware that a petitioner has recently gone out of business. This also includes information that affects national security or public safety garnered from security checks conducted on beneficiaries and petitioners. An officer should not defer to a prior approval when there are indicators of potential fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact. The officer must articulate the new material information in an RFE or NOID.

In all cases, officers must obtain supervisory approval before deviating from a prior approval in their final decision.

H3: 2. Cases Involving Previous Determinations by Other Agencies

USCIS officers consider, but do not defer to, previous eligibility determinations on petitions or applications made by CBP or DOS.[16]Officers make determinations on the petition filed with USCIS and corresponding evidence on record, as provided above.

H2: C. Split Decisions in Extension Requests

Officers may, when warranted, deny an applicant or petitioner’s request to extend the nonimmigrant’s stay in the United States in the same classification.[17]Even if an applicant or petitioner continues to demonstrate eligibility for the nonimmigrant classification, an officer may determine that sufficient reason exists to deny the request for an extension of stay (such as inadmissibility factors or failure to maintain status).

This “split” decision process may result in approval of the petition for the same classification where the petitioner and the beneficiary relationship has not changed, and a simultaneous denial of the extension of stay request.

This technical update removes the guidance in Volume 2, Part A, Chapter 4, Volume 8, Part G, and Volume 12, Part D, Chapter 2 relating to the administration of the public charge ground of inadmissibility under theInadmissibility on Public Charge Groundsfinal rule, 84 FR 41292 (Aug. 14, 2019); as amended byInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds; Correction, 84 FR 52357 (Oct. 2, 2019) ( “Public Charge Final Rule”), which was implemented on Feb. 24, 2020. On Nov. 2, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois vacated the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide. On Nov. 3, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay and, on Nov. 19, 2020, a stay pending appeal of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ Nov. 2, 2020 decision. On Mar. 9, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit lifted its stay and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois’ order vacating the Public Charge Final Rule went into effect. USCIS immediately stopped applying the Public Charge Final Rule to all pending applications and petitions that would have been subject to the rule.

Certain classes of aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility (such as refugees, asylees, certain VAWA self-petitioners, U petitioners, and T applicants) and therefore, are not subject to the Final Rule.
