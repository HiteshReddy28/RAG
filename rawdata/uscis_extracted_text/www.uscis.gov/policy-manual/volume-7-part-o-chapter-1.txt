H2: A. Purpose

USCIS may recognize certain classes of immigrants who entered the United States during specific time periods as having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence even though a record of their admission cannot be found. Such immigrants who have not abandoned status or been ordered excluded, deported, or removed may be eligible for a creation of record of their lawful permanent residence. This process is called “presumption of lawful admission” and is essentially a verification of status, rather than an adjustment of status.

H2: B. Background

As U.S. immigration laws were codified, certain groups of aliens were unable to prove their entry, admission, or immigration status in the United States based on records or other evidence. Various provisions grandfathered these aliens into existing law by allowing for the recording of their lawful admission for permanent residence.

H2: C. Legal Authority

- 8 CFR 101.1– Presumption of lawful admission

- 8 CFR 264.2– Application for creation of record of permanent residence

H2: D. Eligibility Requirements

An immigrant is presumed to be a lawful permanent resident of the United States if he or she can show presence in the United States under any of the standards in8 CFR 101.1. There are more than 30 situations when an immigrant is entitled to presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence. Some merely require that the applicant establish that he or she entered the United States before a certain date. Others require a particular nationality, entry at a particular location, entry by a certain manner, or other requirements. An officer should review the regulation to ensure an applicant is in fact eligible to register his or her lawful permanent residence.

Eligibility to register permanent resident status based on a presumption of lawful admission requires an immigrant to establish that he or she has not abandoned his or her residence in the United States. One of the tests for retention of permanent resident status is continuous residence in the United States.[1]The applicant must also be physically present in the United States at the time he or she files the application.[2]

All presumption of lawful admission cases require an admission to the United States in 1957 or earlier. It is the applicants’ responsibility to establish their admission through documentation, testimony, or affidavits.[3]However, an officer should consider the passage of time since the events in question and the difficulties inherent in documenting events that may have occurred decades ago.

The following table provides a list of eligible classes for presumption of lawful admission and whether evidence of admission is required.

H2: E. Documentation and Evidence

An immigrant should submit the following to establish eligibility for presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence:

- Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485), with the correct fee;

- Two passport-style photographs;

- Copy of government-issued identity document with photograph;

- Copy of birth certificate;

- Evidence of the applicant’s examination, entry, or admission to the United States (if applicable);

- A list of all the applicant’s arrivals into and departures from the United States;

- Evidence substantiating the applicant’s claim to presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence, including proof of maintenance of residence, where required, or any other requirements as specified by regulation;

- A statement by the applicant indicating his or her basis for a claim to presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence; and

- Any other requirements or evidence as specified by regulation.

H2: F. Adjudication

This process does not involve a grant of adjustment of status, but rather, recognition of an applicant’s status. A decision on presumption of admission does not involve any consideration of admissibility or discretion. If an applicant meets the eligibility requirements provided in the regulation,[12]an officer must approve the application.

If an applicant is unable to establish the criteria necessary for presumption of lawful admission, an officer should determine whether the applicant has submitted sufficient evidence to establish eligibility for registry, and if so, adjudicate the application as a request to register lawful permanent residence underINA 249.[13]

If approved, USCIS assigns the following code of admission:

TABLE:
Applicant | Code of Admission
Presumption of Lawful Admission | XB3

The effective date of permanent residence is not the date the application is approved, but rather the date the applicant arrived in the United States under the conditions that created the presumption of lawful admission for permanent residence.[14]

H2: Footnotes

[^ 1]Continuous residence is distinct from continuous physical presence. Although continuous residence and continuous physical presence are related, they have different meanings. Continuous residence refers to maintaining a permanent dwelling place in the United States during the period of time required. In contrast, continuous physical presence refers to the required number of days physically present in the United States during the period of time required. See Volume 12, Citizenship and Naturalization, Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3] and Chapter 4, Physical Presence [12 USCIS-PM D.4].
