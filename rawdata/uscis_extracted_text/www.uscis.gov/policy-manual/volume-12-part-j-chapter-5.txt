H1: Chapter 5 - Administrative Naturalization Ceremonies

- Guidance

- Resources (10)

- Appendices (1)

- Updates (9)

USCIS is committed to elevating the importance of the naturalization ceremony as a venue to recognize the rights, responsibilities, and importance of citizenship and provide access to services for newly naturalized citizens. The naturalization ceremony is the culmination of the naturalization process. USCIS aims to make administrative naturalization ceremonies positive and memorable moments in the lives of the participants. USCIS honors the Oath of Allegiance with policies and practices that reflect the importance of the occasion.

The following information provides USCIS officials with guidance for conducting administrative naturalization ceremonies in a meaningful and consistent manner.[1]

H2: A. Ceremony Check-In Process

USCIS personnel perform the ceremony check-in process before the start of the ceremony. An officer reviews the responses on each alien’s Notice of Naturalization Oath Ceremony (Form N-445) and updates responses as necessary. Once the officer verifies each alien’s eligibility for naturalization, the officer then collects all USCIS-issued travel documents and lawful permanent resident cards from each alien.

H2: B. Materials Distributed

USCIS may distribute materials at administrative naturalization ceremonies, including:

- Important Information for New Citizens (Form M-767 (PDF, 208.39 KB));

- U.S. Citizenship Welcome Packet;

- American flag;

- Citizen’s Almanac (Form M-76);

- President’s Congratulatory Letter; and

- Pocket-size Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States.

During the ceremony, aliens will have access to the Oath of Allegiance and Pledge of Allegiance to repeat during the ceremony.

H3: 1. Citizen’s Almanac and Pocket-size U.S. Declaration of Independence and Constitution

The Citizen’s Almanac (Form M-76 (PDF, 8.53 MB)) and the Pocket-size Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States (Form M-654 (PDF, 1.24 MB)) may be made available to all interested newly naturalized citizens. Officers may make these publications available during administrative ceremonies but are not required to do so. The items may be placed on a table in an area accessible to the newly naturalized citizens. USCIS may also inform newly naturalized citizens that both publications are available for download atuscis.gov/citizenship.

H3: 2. Other Materials

USCIS field office leadership must consult with the USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division to determine whether materials and publications other than the American flag and the contents of the U.S. Citizenship Welcome Packet are appropriate for distribution. Federal workers, including officers, and other invited participants must never distribute the following within the venue where the USCIS naturalization ceremony is taking place, or anywhere within a federal facility or on federal property:

- Partisan publications;

- Publications referencing a specific political group;

- Commercial materials or publications;

- Religious materials or publications; or

- Any promotional or solicitation materials or publications.

Authorized governmental officials invited by USCIS to distribute materials or publications, such as information on voter registration, may provide USCIS-authorized materials at the conclusion of the naturalization ceremony.

Similarly, other authorized U.S. government participants, such as the Department of State’s Passport Services Division and the Social Security Administration may distribute USCIS-authorized materials within the venue after the USCIS official has concluded the naturalization ceremony. Only USCIS-approved materials and publications may be distributed within the venue once the presiding USCIS official has concluded the naturalization ceremony.

H2: C. Ceremony Program

To standardize the naturalization ceremony experience, unless exempted, USCIS offices follow these steps in administrative ceremonies to the extent feasible:[2]

- Play “Faces of America;”

- ​Play the national anthem, The Star Spangled Banner, instrumental or vocal version;[3]

- Deliver opening (welcoming) remarks by Master of Ceremonies;[4]

- Announce the “call of countries;”[5]

- Administer the Oath of Allegiance to the aliens applying for naturalization;[6]

- Deliver keynote remarks (USCIS leadership or guest speaker);

- Play Presidential, Secretary’s, or Director of USCIS’ congratulatory remarks;

- Recite the Pledge of Allegiance;

- Deliver concluding remarks (Master of Ceremonies or USCIS field leadership);[7]and

- Present the Certificate of Naturalization (Form N-550) by USCIS leadership or officers.[8]

The Naturalization Ceremony Presentation[9]includes all required video and musical elements the office plays at various points in the naturalization ceremony program.

Field offices may also enhance the ceremony program with additional appropriate elements, such as approved musical selections included in the Naturalization Ceremony Presentation. When USCIS plays musical selections during ceremonies, aliens applying for naturalization are not required to stand or sing.

H2: D. Guest Speakers

USCIS welcomes distinguished community members who are U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization to participate as guest speakers in administrative naturalization ceremonies. A guest speaker may be a:

- ​Government leader;

- Military leader;

- Member of Congress;

- Judge;

- Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official; or

- A person whom USCIS deems appropriate for the occasion.

Local USCIS field leadership must carefully review and select guest speakers based on their relevance to the occasion, with particular focus on their outstanding achievements, contributions to the nation or their community, personal experience, or notable activities as a citizen of the United States.

USCIS field leadership must review the qualifications of any potential guest speaker who is not a DHS employee, and approve their role in the program before they speak at an administrative naturalization ceremony.[10]If USCIS headquarters selects a guest speaker for a USCIS field office’s administrative naturalization ceremony, headquarters reviews the person’s qualifications before making the recommendation.

It is the responsibility of field leadership of the USCIS office conducting the administrative naturalization ceremony to preserve the importance, dignity, and significance of the occasion. After selecting and scheduling a guest speaker, the local field leadership must send the speaker a written notice, which describes USCIS’ expectations regarding the appropriate length and content of remarks. USCIS must advise speakers that appropriate remarks focus on:

- Importance of U.S. citizenship;

- New privileges (such as the ability to travel with a U.S. passport, apply for a position in the federal government, and vote in federal elections);

- Responsibilities of U.S. citizenship (such as voting and serving on a jury when requested);

- Civic principles within the U.S. government;

- Civic participation in the local community;

- Importance of swearing allegiance to the United States; or

- Theme of the ceremony.

Inappropriate remarks, including political (partisan or otherwise), religious, or commercial statements, are not permitted.[11]Out of respect for the candidates and other attendees, guest speakers serving in the keynote role should deliver remarks between 5 and 10 minutes in length. If a scheduled guest speaker is unable to participate, USCIS must approve any replacement speaker.

USCIS respects the privacy of aliens applying for naturalization and may not release the names or personal information of aliens applying for naturalization unless the alien provides consent or disclosure as required by law.

H2: E. Participation by Elected Officials and Members of Congress

H3: 1. Elected Officials

USCIS must uphold the integrity of each administrative naturalization ceremony and ensure that it is a politically neutral event. The presence of candidates for public office at a naturalization ceremony may create a perception that is inconsistent with USCIS’ obligation of neutrality. Accordingly, candidates for public office, including incumbents, generally may not speak at or participate in an administrative naturalization ceremony starting from 3 months immediately preceding a primary or general election for office.

For example, if the state primary elections are on February 4, 2014, and the state general election is November 3, 2014, a candidate for public office in those primary elections may not be a guest speaker or have another formal participatory role from November 4, 2013 (3 months before the primary election) until after February 4, 2014. A candidate for the general election may not have a participatory role from August 3, 2014 (3 months before the general election) until after November 3, 2014.[12]

The 3-month rule does not apply to the President or Vice President of the United States. However, the 3-month rule does apply to Members of Congress. In exceptional circumstances, the USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division may authorize exceptions to the 3-month rule if the candidate’s participation, subject to any appropriate conditions, would not unduly compromise the ceremony’s political neutrality and would serve the best interest of USCIS and enhance the ceremony. For any exceptions or issues relating to the 3-month rule, field leadership should contact the Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division.

H3: 2. Members of Congress

USCIS congressional liaisons coordinate with USCIS district or field office leadership regarding invitations to and requests from Members of Congress to participate in administrative naturalization ceremonies.

Congressional liaisons and the Field Operations Directorate must provide ample notice when issuing invitations to or responding to requests from Members of Congress to serve as guest speakers in naturalization ceremonies. In the event a Member of Congress is unable to serve as a guest speaker after accepting an invitation to do so, only USCIS may select an appropriate substitute.

When a congressional liaison issues an invitation to a Member’s office, the invitation must include USCIS guidelines for administrative naturalization ceremonies.[13]Members of Congress scheduled to speak at administrative naturalization ceremonies must follow USCIS’ guidance for guest speakers.[14]Members of Congress may not distribute any materials at a USCIS naturalization ceremony or inside the ceremony venue.[15]

Some members of Congress may ask USCIS to schedule naturalization ceremonies to mark particular dates or events of significance to the United States or the U.S. state being represented. USCIS district office or field office leadership may, at their discretion, honor these requests, subject to restrictions for guest speakers.[16]

District office or field office leadership must decline the request if there is any possibility of the event being seen as a platform for any political, controversial, religious, or commercial message. District office or field office leadership may also decline the request if supporting such a ceremony would negatively impact other activities or otherwise present operational hardships.

When a member of Congress asks USCIS to schedule a naturalization ceremony, USCIS responds in writing. If the request is to be honored, the response will provide expectations and restrictions regarding speech for guest speakers.[17]If the request is to be declined, USCIS will provide a reason and a copy of the ceremony guidance.

Members of Congress and their staff are always welcome to attend a naturalization ceremony as members of the public.

H2: F. Voter Registration After Naturalization Ceremonies

H3: 1. Distribution of Voter Registration Applications[18]

The ability to vote in federal elections is a fundamental right that comes with U.S. citizenship.[19]All newly naturalized citizens are given the opportunity to register at the end of the administrative naturalization ceremony when the newly naturalized citizen is then eligible to register to vote.[20]USCIS provides access to voter registration services for the state where the field office is located at each administrative naturalization ceremony.[21]

USCIS offices request election officials from state or local government election offices to attend naturalization ceremonies to distribute, collect, and review state-specific voter registration applications, and to officially register newly naturalized citizens to vote.

If no governmental officials are available to distribute voter registration applications, USCIS field offices provide voter registration applications to all newly naturalized citizens.[22]USCIS is not responsible for the collection of applications or retention of any information from such applications, or any other activities related to voter registration.

H3: 2. Voter Registration Services

The term “voter registration services” includes one or more of the following activities:

- Distribution of voter registration application forms;

- Assisting interested new citizens in completing voter registration application forms;

- Reviewing submitted forms to ensure that each form is complete;

- Collecting completed forms for submission to the local election official; or

- Providing nonpartisan educational information on the voting process.[23]

The mechanism for registration may vary by ceremony location, but in every case must take place only after the conclusion of the ceremony, when the newly naturalized citizens are officially U.S. citizens. USCIS provides space for governmental officials in the same ceremony space or room to provide on-site voter registration services, if available.

If no space is available for governmental officials to provide on-site voter registration services, the USCIS field office distributes voter registration applications to each newly naturalized citizen.[24]USCIS bases a “no space available” determination on the location of the ceremony venue,[25]the size of the venue facility, and the number of aliens applying for naturalization, as well as the layout of the venue space, in accordance with safety standards and regulations. “No space available” determinations are made on a case-by-case basis by USCIS field leadership conducting the ceremony.

H3: 3. Points of Contact for Voting and Voter Registration

If naturalized citizens have questions regarding voting and voter registration, USCIS refers them to:

- The governmental officials offering voter registration services on-site;

- Other information resources within the local area; or

- The appropriate official government websitesUSA.gov Find My State or Local Election Office,USA.gov Register to Vote, andVote.gov.

H2: G. Services Provided by Other Government Entities

Federal entities, such as the Department of State’s Passport Services Division and the Social Security Administration, as well as state and local governments, may be authorized to provide information and make services available to newly naturalized citizens and their guests at the conclusion of the administrative naturalization ceremony.[26]Governmental entities that desire representation at administrative naturalization ceremonies must seek advance approval from field leadership of the USCIS office conducting the ceremony.

H2: H. Participation of Volunteers and Civic Organizations

Field leadership may permit volunteers from the community, community-based organizations, and civic organizations to participate in various roles during the administrative naturalization ceremony. For example, Field leadership may have the U.S. armed forces color guard perform the presentation of colors and the national anthem or have volunteers lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

Field leadership will determine the appropriate level of participation for the occasion. However, under no circumstances will any non-USCIS employee perform any USCIS function.[27]Additionally, only state and local election officials may provide voter registration services.

Field leadership must review the qualifications, designate the level of participation, and oversee the participation of all volunteers and organizations during the administrative naturalization ceremony. In addition, participants must not engage in political, religious, or commercial activity of any kind.

H2: I. Offers to Donate Use of Facilities

USCIS may generally accept offers to donate use of facilities unless they present a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest. Facilities[28]should be neutral and generally not affiliated with any religion, commercial enterprise, political group, or immigration law or advocacy group. The USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division analyzes offers to donate use of facilities for compliance with relevant legal authorities and DHS policy on the acceptance of gifts.

USCIS may generally hold naturalization ceremonies at public events or state or federal government events that take place in diverse settings that provide an educational opportunity for promoting public understanding of the naturalization process such as:

- USCIS offices;

- Federal, state, and local government offices and spaces;

- Federal courts;

- Military installations;

- Sporting event venues;

- U.S. national parks;

- State, county, and local public parks;

- Public libraries and museums;

- Monuments and historic sites;

- Fairs or festivals; and

- Public schools and universities.[29]

Events and locations for oath ceremonies must be consistent with the importance, dignity and significance of the occasion.[30]

When reviewing an offer to use venues and facilities for naturalization ceremonies, USCIS considers whether the acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility:

- Violates or creates the appearance of a violation of the Hatch Act;[31]

- Creates or appears to create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest;

- Creates or appears to create an appearance of lack of impartiality; or

- Creates or appears to create preferential treatment or an endorsement of the donor, or the donor’s products, services, activities, or policies.

USCIS may not use:

- Religious facilities (for example, space in or connected to a place of worship);

- Venues of political affiliation or in conjunction with a political activity, including national conventions and fundraising events;

- Facilities of an organization that practices immigration law;

- Facilities of an organization that is directly engaged in immigration advocacy or immigration policy;

- Facilities concurrently hosting an event[32]for an organization that practices immigration law or is active in immigration advocacy, policy, or immigration lobbying;[33]

- Facilities of an organization[34]that represents petitioners and aliens before DHS; or

- Facilities where USCIS personnel cannot protect secure documents.

USCIS employees must not solicit a gift (including use of facilities to hold an administrative naturalization ceremony) from any non-federal entity.[35]However, USCIS may accept an unsolicited gift with the concurrence of the USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division and approval of the USCIS Director.

Generally, USCIS would not use a donated facility for ceremonies from a prohibited source.[36]

H3: 1. Submission of One-Time Offer to Donate Facility

The donor must submit an invitation letter (on the organization’s letterhead) to the Field Operations Directorate at least 4 weeks in advance of the ceremony date to guarantee timely processing.

In addition to the donor’s submission, an officer must submit Gift Offer Donation Request (Form G-1477)[37]for approval.

H3: 2. Submission of Multi-Date Offers to Donate Facilities

Certain organizations qualify for multi-date gift offer approvals. These include non-federal, nonprofit organizations that USCIS has approved previously for gift offers. In order to qualify for multi-date gift approval, the donor must:

- Have a history of donating use of venue for naturalization ceremonies that were conducted without negative incident;

- Be unlikely to undergo changes of ownership or mission; and

- Submit an invitation letter (on the organization’s letterhead) that specifies the number of ceremonies to be held at the donated venue and the donated value[38]of the gift offer. The invitation letter does not have to identify specific dates of the ceremonies to be held.

The officer must indicate the total yearly value for all multi-date offers submitted on the Gift Offer Donation Request (Form G-1477).[39]Notwithstanding a prior approval, changes in a donor’s ownership, mission, or operations may warrant denying use of venue space prospectively.

Duration of Approved Multi-Date Offers

Multi-date gift offers are valid for 1 year from the time of approval of the request.

Subsequent Uses of Approved Multi-Date Offers

The donor of a previously approved multi-date gift offer to donate use of facilities does not need to submit a new submission for approval. New submissions for review and approval are only needed in instances where:

- The gift value exceeds the total previously listed gift value[40]in the original submission;

- There is a change in the donated venue location;

- There is a substantive change to ownership, mission, or stability of the organization; or

- Any other changes arise that create a new actual or apparent conflict of interest.

H3: 3. Review of Offer

After receipt, an authorized official reviews the documents for accuracy and consistency. The following officials then review and consider the gift offer for approval (in order of review):

- USCIS Field Operations;

- USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division; and

- USCIS Director (final approval).

Field leadership may accept a gift offer or donated facility for ceremony use from a federal, state, or local governmental entity without the submission of a gift offer letter and approval of the USCIS Director. However, before accepting such an offer, field leadership must consider if acceptance would create or appear to create a conflict of interest. If field leadership is unable to determine whether the offer would create or appear to create a conflict of interest, field leadership should confer with the USCIS Office of the Chief Counsel’s Ethics Division before accepting the offer.

H3: 4. Rejection of Offer

USCIS may not accept an offer of use of facilities if:

- The gift offer would not aid or facilitate the mission of USCIS and DHS;

- The acceptance of the gift would create or appear to create a conflict of interest or appearance of a conflict of interest;

- The donor seeks to obtain or conduct business with USCIS or DHS;

- The donor conducts operations or activities that are regulated by USCIS or DHS;

- The acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility would reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the agency, or any employee of the agency, to carry out USCIS and DHS responsibilities or official duties in a fair and objective manner;

- The acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility would compromise the integrity or the appearance of the integrity of USCIS or DHS programs or any official involved in those programs;

- The acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility would violate, or create the appearance of a violation of the Hatch Act;[41]

- The acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility might reasonably create the appearance of preferential treatment or official endorsement of an outside entity; or

- The acceptance of the gift or use of the donated facility would be inconsistent with USCIS’ interest in upholding the importance, dignity, and significance of the occasion.

The authorized agency officials may consider various factors, including the following, in their determination:

- The identity of the donor;

- The monetary or estimated market value or the cost to the donor;

- The purpose of the gift as described in any written statement or oral proposal by the donor;

- The identity of any other expected recipients of the gift on the same occasion, if any;

- The timing of the gift;

- The number of times the donor has offered gifts to USCIS;

- The nature and sensitivity of any matter pending before the agency that may affect the interest of the donor;

- The importance or consequence of an individual employee's role in any matter affecting the donor (for example, if benefits of the gift will accrue to the employee); and

- The nature of the offered gift.

At the end of the gift offer process, USCIS provides notification of the acceptance or rejection of the gift offer to the donor.

H2: J. Coordination with External Organizations

When USCIS hosts an administrative naturalization ceremony[42]in which an external organization (such as another federal agency) plays a role,[43]USCIS is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the event is important, dignified, and significant. While USCIS welcomes participation from external organizations, USCIS does not formally co-host ceremonies with external organizations.

H3: 1. USCIS Responsibilities

In conducting administrative ceremonies, USCIS is responsible for the following:

- Approving the ceremony facility – USCIS follows internal policies and procedures regarding the use of space, including donations of space.[44]Prior to selecting the facility, USCIS reserves the right to conduct a site visit of the proposed space.

- Planning the ceremony – USCIS determines the ceremony program, including the order of events, the order of speakers, the seating arrangements of the speakers on stage, and security measures appropriate for the venue.[45]

- Ensuring the ceremony remains the focus of the event.

- Ensuring proper use and placement of the DHS seal and signature according to approved guidelines.[46]When coordinating with an external entity, USCIS must avoid perceived endorsement.

- Selecting, inviting, and approving guest speakers – USCIS must approve all guest speakers. While the collaborating organization may recommend guest speakers to USCIS, the selection is at the discretion of USCIS. USCIS may request to review guest speaker remarks in advance of the ceremony for content and length. Inappropriate remarks, including political (partisan or otherwise), commercial, or religious statements, are not permitted.[47]

- Determining which naturalization candidates will participate in the ceremony – Organizations may not request that specific lawful permanent residents (LPRs) be naturalized at any ceremony (for example, only LPRs from a particular country). USCIS will not consider such requests, which may create a conflict of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment to specific LPRs.

- Ensuring that voter registration applications are offered to new citizens at the end of the ceremony.[48]

- Preserving the importance, dignity, and significance of naturalization ceremonies.

USCIS may brief all ceremony participants on expected behavior.

H3: 2. External Organizations

The external organization is responsible for:

- Following all USCIS policies and procedures, including guidance from field leadership.

- Seeking approval from USCIS prior to distributing any materials at the ceremony. If the external organization wishes to distribute American flags to ceremony guests, those flags should be made in the United States. USCIS provides flags for all naturalization candidates.

- Coordinating with USCIS on media coverage of the naturalization ceremony.

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
