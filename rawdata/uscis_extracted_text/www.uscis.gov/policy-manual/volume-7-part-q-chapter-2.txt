A person who has adjusted status to that of a person lawfully admitted for permanent residence underINA 210,240A, (the former) 244,245,245A, or249, or under any other provision of law may be placed into rescission proceedings at any time during the first 5 years after the granting of permanent residence, if:

- USCIS determines that the person was not eligible for adjustment of status at the time that permanent residence was granted; and

- The person would have not been eligible for adjustment under any other provision of law.[1]

A determination that a person is not subject to rescission proceedings does not necessarily mean that no further action may be taken. A person who is not subject to rescission may still be subject to removal proceedings.[2]

This technical update is part of an initiative to move existing policy guidance from the Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) into the Policy Manual. This update does not make major substantive changes but consolidates and incorporates existing AFM guidance into the Policy Manual, streamlining USCIS’ immigration policy while removing obsolete information. This guidance replaces Chapters 22.3 and 26 of the AFM, related appendices, and policy memoranda.

6 USCIS-PM H-Part H - Designated and Special Immigrants

7 USCIS-PM Q-Part Q - Rescission of Lawful Permanent Residence

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
