H2: A. General Provisions

In general, an applicant submits an Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document (Form N-565) to request a replacement Certificate of Citizenship or Certificate of Naturalization. The application must be submitted with the appropriate fee and in accordance with the form instructions.[5]

A person may request a replacement certificate to replace a lost or mutilated certificate. A person may also request a replacement certificate, without fee, in cases where:

- USCIS issued a certificate that does not conform to the supportable facts shown on the applicant’s citizenship or naturalization application;[6]or

- USCIS committed a clerical error in preparing the certificate.[7]

H2: B. Requests to Change Name or Date of Birth

H3: 1. Certificates of Naturalization

Applicants may submitForm N-565to update their name on a replacement Certificate of Naturalization based on a name change ordered by a state court with jurisdiction, or by operation of law, including a common law name change evidenced by a state-issued identification document, or a name change resulting from marriage or divorce.[8]

Unless there is a USCIS clerical error, regulations prohibit USCIS from making any changes to a date of birth on a Certificate of Naturalization if the applicant has completed the naturalization process and sworn to the facts of the application, including the date of birth (DOB).[9]

H3: 2. Certificates of Citizenship

Applicants may submitForm N-565to request issuance of a replacement Certificate of Citizenship to correct the name or DOB if they have obtained a state-issued document with a corrected name or DOB. Along with their application and the appropriate fee, applicants must submit the court order or other state vital record.[10]

H2: C. Clerical Errors

Applicants may submitForm N-565to request issuance of a replacement Certificate of Citizenship or a Certificate of Naturalization to correct the name or DOB if the correction is justified due to USCIS error.[11]No filing fee is required when an application is filed based on a USCIS error.

[^ 9]See8 CFR 338.5(e). The regulation at8 CFR 338.5(e)specifically provides that USCIS will not deem a request to change a DOB justified if the naturalization certificate contains the DOB provided by the applicant at the time of naturalization.

L. 101-649  (PDF)(November 29, 1990), which transferred the authority over naturalization from the courts to the executive branch. For naturalization certificates issued by a court prior to 1991, the regulations provide that USCIS may “authorize” the court to make a change on the certificate if it is the result of clerical error. However, USCIS plays a minimal role in these cases. See8 CFR 338.5(b)and8 CFR 338.5(e).

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
