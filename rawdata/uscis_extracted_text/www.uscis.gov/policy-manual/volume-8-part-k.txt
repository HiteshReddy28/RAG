This technical update to Volume 8 modifies several footnotes to note the divergence from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)’s decision inMatter of Richmond, 26 I&N Dec. 779, 787 (BIA 2016) in the Eleventh Circuit. InPatel v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 971 F.3d 1258, 1272 (11th Cir. 2020) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit held that a false claim to U.S. citizenship does not have to be material in order to result in inadmissibility. This decision only applies to cases within the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit, which covers Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. This update also removes redundant footnotes.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
