H2: A. Purpose

To properly control movement across its borders, a government must be able to scrutinize and assess a person’s identity as part of determining eligibility to enter. If an alien willfully provides incorrect information about his or her identity and intentions for entering the country, he or she has deprived the government of its right to examine the request for admission.[1]

In recognition of these principles, Congress provided a specific ground of inadmissibility to address the use of fraud or willful misrepresentation when obtaining a benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

There are exceptions and waivers to inadmissibility due to fraud or willful misrepresentation available to an alien under certain circumstances depending on the particular immigration benefit sought.[2]

H2: B. Background

The 1924 Immigration Act[3]made obtaining a visa under a false name or submitting false evidence in support of a visa application a federal crime. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and the courts used this principle to find that a visa obtained by fraud was no visa at all, making the alien’s admission with a fraudulent visa unlawful.[4]

Congress codified the BIA’s and the courts’ approach in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. With former INA 212(a)(19), it created a new bar to admission for any applicant who used fraud or willful misrepresentation to gain entry into the United States or obtain a visa or other documentation.[5]

In 1986, Congress amended the bar so that an alien could be found inadmissible for using fraud or willful misrepresentation when seeking any benefit under the INA, not just entry, visas, or other documents.[6]Congress re-designated former INA 212(a)(19) asINA 212(a)(6)(C)in 1990 but did not alter the bar to admission itself.[7]Substantive changes to the inadmissibility ground did not come until 1996, when Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA).[8]

With the passage of IIRIRA, Congress created two separate inadmissibility grounds that remain unchanged to this day:[9]

- Fraud or willful misrepresentation made in connection with obtaining an immigration benefit;[10]and

- False claim to U.S. citizenship made on or after September 30, 1996.[11]

These two grounds differ significantly. This Part J only addresses the inadmissibility determination for fraud or willful misrepresentation made in connection with obtaining an immigration benefit. This includes, however, false claims to U.S. citizenship made prior to September 30, 1996.

Aliens who made a false claim to U.S. citizenship prior to September 30, 1996, cannot be found inadmissible under the false claim to U.S. citizenship ground of inadmissibility.[12]IIRIRA made this ground applicable only to false claims made on or after September 30, 1996.[13]

Therefore, for false claims to U.S. citizenship made before September 30, 1996, the officer must analyze the alien's inadmissibility according to the general fraud and willful misrepresentation ground of inadmissibility, as outlined in this Part J.[14]

H2: C. Scope

This guidance addresses inadmissibility for fraud and willful misrepresentation[15]in relation to obtaining a benefit under the INA, including inadmissibility for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship before September 30, 1996.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is updating and incorporating relevant Adjudicator’s Field Manual (AFM) content into the USCIS Policy Manual. As that process is ongoing, USCIS has moved any remaining AFM content to its corresponding USCIS Policy Manual Part, in PDF format, until relevant AFM content has been properly incorporated into the USCIS Policy Manual. To the extent that a provision in the USCIS Policy Manual conflicts with remaining AFM content or Policy Memoranda, the updated information in the USCIS Policy Manual prevails. To find remaining AFM content, see thecrosswalkbetween the AFM and the Policy Manual.
