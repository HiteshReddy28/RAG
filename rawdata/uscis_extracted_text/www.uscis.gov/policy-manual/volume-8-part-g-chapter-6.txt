H2: A. Background

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) created the requirement for a legally enforceable affidavit of support to reduce the potential for an intending immigrant to become a public charge.[1]When required, the applicant must submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA (Form I-864orForm I-864EZ)[2]completed by a sponsor.

Form I-864[3]is a legally enforceable contract that a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or lawful permanent resident (LPR) signs to accept financial responsibility for an alien, usually a relative, who is coming to the United States to live permanently. Form I-864[4]is legally binding and requires a sponsor to maintain the applicant at an annual income of no less than 125 percent of theFederal Poverty Guidelines(FPG).[5]The U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or LPR who signs the Form I-864 becomes the immigrant’s sponsor once the applicant becomes an LPR.

For Form I-864 to be sufficient, a sponsor generally must demonstrate that the sponsor is able to maintain the sponsored alien at an annual income of not less than 125 percent of the FPG.[6]The presence of a sufficient Form I-864 does not eliminate the need to consider all of the factors of a public charge inadmissibility determination, and USCIS only considers it as one factor in the totality of the circumstances.[7]However, the statute requires a finding of inadmissibility on the public charge ground if the alien is required to submit an affidavit of support and fails to do so.[8]

H2: B. Applicants Required to File Form I-864

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines which aliens are required to submit a legally enforceableForm I-864.[9]Most aliens intending to immigrate or to adjust status as immediate relatives or the family-sponsored preference categories, and in certain employment-based categories after December 19, 1997, are required to submit Form I-864 signed by a sponsor.[10]

Aliens required to submit an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, and who are not otherwise exempt, are inadmissible on the public charge ground if they do not submit a sufficient Form I-864.[11]

H3: 1. Immediate Relatives and Family-Sponsored Preference Immigrants

In general, most aliens applying for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status based on a family relationship are required to submit Form I-864. The following table outlines categories of applicants by immigrant category who must submit Form I-864 unless otherwise exempt:

TABLE:
Immediate Relatives and Family-Sponsored Preference Immigrants
Immediate Relatives of U.S. Citizens | U.S. citizens’ parents, spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21, including most orphans and Hague Convention adoptees[12]
First Preference | Unmarried sons and daughters of U.S. citizens who are 21 years of age or older, including their unmarried children[13]
Second Preference | Spouses, children, and unmarried sons and daughters of LPRs, including their unmarried children[14]
Third Preference | Married sons and married daughters of U.S. citizens, including their spouses and unmarried children[15]
Fourth Preference | Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens, including their spouses and unmarried minor children[16]

All of these applicants are required to submit Form I-864, unless exempt from the requirement.

H3: 2. Certain Employment-Based Immigrants

In general, most aliens applying for an employment-based immigrant visa or adjustment of status are not required to file Form I-864.[17]Applicants seeking LPR status based on an employment-based petition are required to file Form I-864 if:

- The petitioner is a relative of the applicant;[18]or

- The petitioner is an entity[19]in which the applicant’s relative has a significant ownership interest.[20]

These applicants are required to file Form I-864 unless an exception applies.

H3: 3. K Nonimmigrants

Principal K nonimmigrants[21]seeking adjustment of status must submit Form I-864.[22]This requirement also applies to an alien who seeks adjustment after having been admitted as the child of a principal K nonimmigrant.

Any applicant for adjustment of status based on a K nonimmigrant visa must submit a Form I-864 at the time of adjustment of status. Termination of the marriage between the K-1 beneficiary and the petitioner does not end the K-1 nonimmigrant’s eligibility for adjustment.[23]

A former spouse can still be the sponsor who submits the Form I-864 for a K-1 and a K-2 nonimmigrant to adjust status. However, if the former spouse does not submit the Form I-864, or timely withdraws one already submitted, the K-1 and K-2 nonimmigrants are inadmissible based on the public charge ground unless an exception applies.[24]

H3: 4. Accompanying Spouse or Child

A spouse or child is considered to be accompanying a principal immigrant if:

- The spouse or child applies for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status at the same time as the principal immigrant; or

- The spouse or child applies for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status within 6 months after the date the principal immigrant acquires LPR status.

If the principal applicant is required to have a Form I-864, then any accompanying spouse or child must also be included on that affidavit of support. To meet the requirement, the accompanying spouse or child must submit a photocopy of the principal applicant’s Form I-864. A photocopy of the principal’s supporting documentation,[25]however, is not required.

H3: 5. Following-to-Join Spouse or Child

When a spouse or a child of a principal applicant applies for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status 6 months or more after the principal immigrant, the spouse or child is considered to be following-to-join the principal.

If the principal applicant is required to have a Form I-864, then the following-to-join spouse or child must also have a Form I-864. Each following-to-join spouse or child requires a Form I-864, independent of the principal applicant’s Form I-864, at the time of adjustment of status or consular processing.[26]

H3: 6. T and U Nonimmigrants, VAWA Self-Petitioners, and Certain “Qualified Aliens” Subject to Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA Requirements

In general,INA 212(a)(4)(E)provides that the following provisions do not apply to “qualified alien” victims:

- Public charge inadmissibility, in general;[27]

- Minimum factors to be considered in the public charge inadmissibility determination;[28]and

- Inadmissibility for lack of sufficient affidavit of support for family-based immigrants.[29]

A “qualified alien” victim[30]includes:

- A Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioner;

- An alien who is an applicant for, or is granted, U nonimmigrant status;[31]or

- A “qualified alien” as described in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA),[32]such as an alien who has a pending application establishing prima facie eligibility for T nonimmigrant status or has been granted T nonimmigrant status.

When Congress created the current version of INA 212(a)(4)(E), it did not exempt qualified “alien victims” from the requirements under INA 212(a)(4)(D). INA 212(a)(4)(D) makes an alien inadmissible on public charge in employment-based cases,[33]unless the alien has a properly executed Form I-864 from the alien’s relative if:[34]

- The alien’s relative filed the employment-based petition; or

- The alien’s relative has a significant ownership interest (of 5 percent or more) in the business or entity that filed the employment-based petition.

If the qualified “alien victim” files for adjustment of status under an employment-based category and their petitioning employer meets the above circumstances but does not submit a sufficient Form I-864,[35]then the alien is inadmissible on the public charge ground.

H2: C. Applicants Not Required to File Form I-864

Certain applicants are not statutorily required to submit a Form I-864. Other applicants, although generally required to file a Form I-864, may be exempt from this requirement. Being exempt from the Form I-864 requirement is different from being exempt from the public charge inadmissibility ground.[36]

An officer still makes an inadmissibility determination for an applicant who is exempt from the Form I-864 filing requirement unless the alien is also exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility.[37]

H3: 1. Applicants Exempt from Filing Form I-864

Some categories of adjustment of status applicants are exempt from the Form I-864 requirement but must request an exemption from the Form I-864 requirement when filing their Form I-485 to establish that a Form I-864 is not required.[38]

These categories include children of U.S. citizens who will automatically become U.S. citizens under theChild Citizenship Act of 2000  (PDF)(CCA)[39]upon their admission to the United States, self-petitioning widows and widowers of U.S. citizens, and self-petitioning battered spouses and children. Applicants who have earned (or can be credited with) 40 quarters (credits) of coverage under theSocial Security Act   (PDF)may also request an exemption from the Form I-864 requirement to establish that a Form I-864 is not required.[40]

Certain Children of U.S. Citizens

Under the CCA, children born abroad to U.S. citizens may automatically acquire U.S. citizenship if, before their 18th birthday, are residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent pursuant to an admission as an immigrant or adjustment of status to that of an LPR.[41]If qualified for automatic acquisition of citizenship, the child is exempt from the Form I-864 requirement.[42]

The CCA has specific provisions for alien children adopted by U.S. citizens. An alien child adopted by U.S. citizens, such as orphans or Hague Adoptees (IR-3 or IH-3 classifications) automatically acquires U.S. citizenship if the child enters the United States before the child’s 18th birthday and resides with the U.S. citizen parent.[43]Therefore, these children are exempt from the affidavit of support requirement.

However, this exception does not apply if:

- The child is “coming to be adopted” as an orphan or Hague Adoptee (IR-4 or IH-4 classification);[44]or

- The child is admitted as an immediate relative immigrant as the stepchild of a U.S. citizen.[45]

Certain Self-Petitioning Immigrants

The following self-petitioning immigrants are exempt from the Form I-864 requirement:

- An alien who has an approved Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant (Form I-360) as a self-petitioning widow or widower;[46]

- An alien who has an approvedForm I-360as a battered spouse or child;[47]and

- An alien who has an approvedForm I-360as a VAWA self-petitioner.[48]

Applicants Who Have Earned or Can be Credited with 40 Qualifying Quarters of Work

An alien who has earned or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters (credits) of work in the United States under theSocial Security Act  (PDF)(SSA) is exempt from the requirement to file aForm I-864.[49]A quarter, as defined by the Social Security Administration, is a period of 3 calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.[50]

An alien can acquire 40 qualifying quarters through any of the following circumstances:

- Any quarter during which the alien works in the United States, as long as the alien received the minimum income established by the Social Security Administration during the entire quarter;[51]

- Being credited with quarters the alien’s spouse worked during the marriage;[52]

- Being credited with any quarters during which the alien was under 18 years of age and the alien’s parent worked;[53]or

- A combination of the above.[54]

Since 1978, quarters are based on total wages and self-employment income earned during the year, regardless of the months during the year the actual work was performed. An applicant can earn all four credits for the year in less time if the applicant earns the required income.

For example, in 2014, a person must have earned $1,200 in covered earnings to earn one Social Security or Medicare work credit and $4,800 to earn the maximum four credits for the year. A person who earned $4,800 in 2014 earned all four credits for the year regardless of how long that year it took to earn the income.

An officer does not need to calculate an applicant’s quarters. Applicants who claim they can be credited with sufficient quarters of coverage must submit official Social Security records to support the claim.[55]

H3: 2. Adjustment Applications Filed Before December 19, 1997

Any applicant for adjustment of status who filed an Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485) before December 19, 1997 is exempt from the requirement to file an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA.[56]The exemption is dependent on the filing date and applies even if USCIS conducts the interview or adjudicates the case after that date.

H3: 3. Other Categories of Applicants Not Required to File Form I-864

The following are categories of immigrants who are not required to file an Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA withForm I-485, but who are subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility:[57]

- Diversity immigrants;[58]

- Employment-based immigrants, unless the visa petition was filed by a relative or an entity in which the applicant’s relative has a significant ownership interest, as described above;[59]

- Immigrant investors;[60]

- Diplomats or high-ranking officials unable to return home (Section 13 of the Act of September 11, 1957);[61]

- Polish or Hungarian Parolees;[90]

- Applicants adjusting under Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness (LRIF);[91]

- Certain Syrian nationals;[92]and

- Any other categories of aliens exempt under any other law from the public charge ground of inadmissibility provisions under INA 212(a)(4).

H2: D. Consideration of Form I-864 as a Factor in the Totality of the Circumstances Analysis

Under the statute, the minimum income the sponsor must demonstrate for a Form I-864 to be deemed sufficient is generally 125 percent of theFPG[93]based on the sponsor’s household size.[94]

Sponsored immigrants[95]are considered less likely to turn to the government first for financial support because they can and have been known to successfully enforce the statutory requirement that sponsors provide financial support to the sponsored immigrant at the level required by statute for the period the obligation is in effect.[96]Therefore, USCIS will favorably consider a sufficient Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, when required, in making a public charge inadmissibility determination.[97]

Additionally, federal and state deeming provisions reduce the likelihood that a sponsored alien would be eligible for a means-tested benefit, and therefore, less likely to become primarily dependent on the government for subsistence at any time in the future.[98]Therefore, a sufficientForm I-864is a positive consideration in the totality of the circumstances. However, a sufficientForm I-864does not, alone, result in a finding that an alien is not inadmissible under the public charge ground due to the statute’s requirement to consider the statutory minimum factors.[99]

For additional information, seePublic Charge Inadmissibility Determinations in Illinois. Certain classes of aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility (such as refugees, asylees, certain VAWA self-petitioners, U petitioners, and T applicants) and therefore, are not subject to the Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds final rule. For more information about the classes of [noncitizens] who are exempt from the final rule, see theappendicesrelated to applicability.
