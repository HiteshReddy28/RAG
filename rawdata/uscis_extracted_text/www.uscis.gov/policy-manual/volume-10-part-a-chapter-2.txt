H1: Chapter 2 - Eligibility Requirements

- Guidance

- Resources (10)

- Appendices (0)

- Updates (6)

Whether or not an alien is authorized to work in the United States depends on the alien's immigration status or circumstances.[1]The regulations outline three classes of eligibility for employment authorization:

- Authorization to work for any employer, as well as to engage in self-employment, based on immigration status or circumstances;[2]

- Authorization to work for a specific employer based on immigration status or circumstances;[3]and

- Authorization to work for any employer, as well as to engage in self-employment, upon approval, in the discretion of USCIS, of an Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765).[4]

H2: A. Authorized to Work for Any Employer Based on Status or Circumstances

H3: 1. Aliens Who Must Apply for Documentation of Employment Authorization

Certain aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction based on their underlying immigration status or circumstances.[5]However, aliens seeking employment in the United States must present an acceptable document or combination of documents to their employer as evidence of both identity and employment authorization.[6]In general, most aliens authorized to work for any employer based on their status or circumstance must apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization.

The following aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction, based on their status or circumstance, but generally must apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization if seeking employment in the United States:[7]

- Refugees;[8]

- Certain Afghan parolees and certain Ukrainian parolees;[9]

- Fiancé(e)s of U.S. citizens or children of such fiancé(e)s (K-1 or K-2 nonimmigrants);[10]

- Parents or dependent children of aliens granted LPR status based on being an employee of a recognized international organization (or such an employee’s family member);[11]

- Citizens of Palau;[12]

- Aliens granted withholding of deportation or removal;[13]

- Aliens under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED);[14]

- Aliens granted temporary protected status (TPS);[15]

- Aliens granted voluntary departure under the Family Unity Program or granted Family Unity benefits;[16]

- V nonimmigrants; and

- Aliens granted Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) resident status (employment authorization is limited to the CNMI).[17]

Generally, aliens in the above categories need to submitForm I-765to USCIS with the appropriate fee, in accordance with the form instructions,[18]to receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as evidence of such authorization if they intend to work in the United States.[19]

H3: 2. Aliens Who Do Not Need to Apply for Documentation of Employment Authorization

The following aliens are authorized to work in the United States without restriction, based on their status or circumstance, and generally do not need to apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization if seeking employment in the United States because the documentation they receive showing their status or circumstance may generally also be used to show employment authorization:

- Lawful permanent residents (LPRs) (with or without conditions);[20]

- Lawful temporary residents;[21]

- Asylees;[22]

- Citizens of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands;[23]

- Spouses of U.S. citizens or children of such spouses (K-3 or K-4 nonimmigrants);[24]

- Victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons (T-1 nonimmigrants);[25]

- Spouses of principal E nonimmigrants;[26]

- Spouses of principal L-1 nonimmigrants;[27]and

- Victims of qualifying criminal activity (U-1 nonimmigrants)[28]and certain qualifying family members (U-2, U-3, U-4, and U-5 nonimmigrants).[29]

Although these aliens are not required to apply to USCIS for a document evidencing employment authorization, they must still present acceptable evidence of identity and employment authorization when seeking employment in the United States.[30]

Documentation DHS Issues as Evidence of Employment Authorization

LPRs may present a Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551), a foreign passport that contains a temporary I-551 stamp, or a temporary I-551 notation on a machine-readable visa as evidence of both identity and employment authorization.[31]

Asylees, spouses of U.S. citizens or children of such spouses (K-3 and K-4 nonimmigrants), victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons (T-1 nonimmigrants), spouses of E nonimmigrants (E-1S, E-2S, or E-3S nonimmigrants) with limited exceptions,[32]spouses of L nonimmigrants (L-2S nonimmigrants), and victims of qualifying criminal activity (U-1 nonimmigrants) and certain qualifying family members (U-2, U-3, U-4, and U-5 nonimmigrants) may present their Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94)[33]as acceptable evidence of employment authorization underList C of Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9).[34]

However, aliens seeking employment in the United States who present their Form I-94 to an employer as evidence of employment authorization must also present a document to show evidence of identity.[35]The Form I-94 is not evidence of identity and for the categories of aliens listed above can be presented as evidence of employment authorization.

To obtain a document evidencing both identity and employment authorization, these aliens may apply for an EAD, with the appropriate fee (or request a fee waiver), if applicable. However, certain categories of aliens are automatically issued an EAD showing both identity and employment authorization based on their status and are not required to apply separately for an EAD.[36]

H2: B. Authorized to Work for Specific Employer Based on Status or Circumstances

The following nonimmigrants and parolees are automatically authorized to work for a specific employer based on their particular nonimmigrant status or parole:[37]

- Foreign government officials (A-1 or A-2 nonimmigrants), or employees of such official (A-3 nonimmigrants);[38]

Nonimmigrants authorized to work for a specific employer based on status or circumstances are not required to file aForm I-765to obtain authorization to work in the United States; they receive employment authorization automatically once they are admitted into the United States in, or change to, the qualifying nonimmigrant status or parole. These aliens are, however, subject to certain restrictions as a condition of their status or parole. Generally, they are only allowed to work for the employer named in their respective nonimmigrant petition or parole application and only allowed to perform the type of work specified in their petition or application.[64]Certain classes of nonimmigrants may continue their employment with the same employer for up to 240 days after the expiration of a prior authorized period of stay, provided they are the beneficiary of a timely filed petition or application for an extension of stay using the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (Form I-129) or Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status (Form I-539).[65]

For example, aliens who have received voluntary departure or withholding of deportation do not have an immigration status, but the provision of law under which they are permitted to be in the United States also provides employment authorization.

Form I-94 for dependents solely notated with E-1, E-2, E-2C, E-3, E-3D, or E-3R nonimmigrant status is insufficient to evidence employment authorization. Not all spouses of principal E nonimmigrants are considered employment authorized incident to status; exceptions apply.

Additionally, as noted in8 CFR 214.2(e)(23)(x)(B), spouses of E-2 CNMI investors who obtained such status based upon a Foreign Retiree Investment Certificate are not eligible for work authorization.
