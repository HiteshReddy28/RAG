H2: A. Purpose

U.S. citizenship confers important rights and responsibilities, including the right to vote and to hold public office. U.S. citizens also have an unqualified right to live in the United States. In recognition of these principles, Congress provided a specific ground of inadmissibility to address when an alien falsely claims to be a U.S. citizen for any purpose or benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or any other federal or state law. Indeed, the immigration consequences for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship are severe.[1]The alien is permanently barred from admission.[2]

There are exceptions and waivers to this ground of inadmissibility. The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to waive inadmissibility for purposes of a nonimmigrant admission. A waiver is not available, however, to most aliens seeking lawful permanent resident (LPR) status.

H2: B. Background

Congress added the ground of inadmissibility for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship with the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA).[3]Prior to the passage of IIRIRA, an alien who falsely claimed U.S. citizenship for purposes of immigration benefits was inadmissible because of fraud and willful misrepresentation.[4]Concerned about aliens’ increased use of fraud to access various federal benefits,[5]Congress divided the provision into two separate inadmissibility grounds including:[6]

- Fraud or willful misrepresentation made in connection with obtaining an immigration benefit;[7]and

- False claim to U.S. citizenship made on or after September 30, 1996 in connection with obtaining any benefit or for any purpose under federal or state law, including immigration law.[8]

These two grounds differ significantly. This part only addresses the inadmissibility determination for false claims to U.S. citizenship made on or after September 30, 1996, the date that the new inadmissibility ground for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship became effective.

The officer cannot make a finding of inadmissibility under the false claim to U.S. citizenship ground of inadmissibility for aliens who made a false claim to U.S. citizenship prior to September 30, 1996.[9]In those cases, the officer must analyze the alien’s inadmissibility according to the fraud and willful misrepresentation ground of inadmissibility.[10]

This distinction is important, because aliens who made a false claim to U.S. citizenship before September 30, 1996, may apply for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility for fraud and misrepresentation.[11]Aliens who made a false claim to U.S. citizenship on or after September 30, 1996, generally are not eligible for waivers if they seek permanent resident status.[12]

The chart below outlines the distinctions between the inadmissibility grounds of fraud or willful misrepresentation[13]and falsely claiming U.S. citizenship.[14]

[^ 1]Falsely claiming U.S. citizenship is also a criminal offense under18 U.S.C. 911. This Part K does not address the criminal consequences of falsely claiming U.S. citizenship but addresses when a criminal conviction is evidence for purposes of the inadmissibility determination.

[^ 2]SeeINA 212(d)(3). If the alien needs a nonimmigrant visa, then the Department of State (DOS) must concur in the waiver.
