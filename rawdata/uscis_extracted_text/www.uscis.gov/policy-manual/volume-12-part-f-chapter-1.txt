H2: A. Purpose

One of the general requirements for naturalization is good moral character (GMC). GMC means character which measures up to the standards of average citizens of the community in which the alien resides.[1]The purpose of demonstrating GMC for naturalization is to ensure that the alien is suitable to become a U.S. citizen, reflecting the values and standards expected of a U.S. citizen.

In general, an alien must show that he or she has been and continues to be a person of GMC during the statutory period prior to filing and up to the time of the Oath of Allegiance.[2]

The applicable naturalization provision under which the alien files determines the period during which the alien must demonstrate GMC.[3]The alien’s conduct outside the GMC period may also impact whether he or she meets the GMC requirement.[4]

While USCIS determines whether an alien has met the GMC requirement on a case-by-case basis, certain types of criminal conduct automatically preclude aliens from establishing GMC and may make the alien subject to removal proceedings.[5]An alien may also be found to lack GMC for other types of criminal conduct (or unlawful acts).

An officer’s assessment of whether an alien meets the GMC requirement includes an officer’s review of:

- The alien’s record;

- Statements provided in the naturalization application; and

- Oral testimony provided during the interview.

There may be cases that are affected by specific jurisdictional case law. The officer should rely on local USCIS counsel in cases where there is a question about whether a particular offense rises to the level of precluding an alien from establishing GMC. In addition, the offenses and conduct which affect the GMC determination may also render an alien removable.

H2: B. Background

The Naturalization Act of 1790 first introduced the long-standing GMC requirement for naturalization requiring an alien applying for naturalization to demonstrate “good character.”[6]Subsequent enactments[7]incorporated “good moral character” and it remains a requirement for naturalization to this day.[8]

Prior to 1940, the statute read “behaved as a man of good moral character.”[9]Since 1940, the statute has stated “has been and still is a person of good moral character.”[10]Until 1952, the statute provided no guidance on character determination. Rather, where the statute did not bar a finding of good moral character, the standard was judicially defined on a case-by-case basis.[11]If the court determined the alien was a “thoroughly law-abiding and industrious man, of good moral character,” and was otherwise eligible the alien became a U.S. citizen.[12]

In 1952, Congress revamped the immigration and naturalization laws, passing the comprehensive Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (INA), also known as the McCarran-Walter Act.[13]It provided the first definition for good moral character in the citizenship context.[14]While the INA does not specifically define what “good moral character is,” Congress did explicitly state what it is not.INA 101(f)lists certain conduct that precludes a person from demonstrating good moral character.[15]

The amendment also included a catch-all provision, stating that an alien may lack good moral character even if he or she does not fit into any of the eight enumerated classes.[16]Judicial precedent holds that good moral character under the immigration laws requires adherence to the standards of average citizens in the community.[17]

Thus, any conduct or act that offends the accepted moral character standards of the community[18]in which the alien applying for naturalization resides should be considered without regard to whether the alien has been arrested or convicted of an offense.

In general, an alien applying for naturalization must establish GMC throughout the requisite periods of continuous residence in the United States.[19]In prescribing specific periods during which GMC must be established, Congress generally intended to make provision for the reformation and eventual naturalization of persons who were guilty of certain past misconduct. The good moral character standard has proliferated throughout the INA and is now a prerequisite to eligibility for numerous immigration benefits.[20]

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
