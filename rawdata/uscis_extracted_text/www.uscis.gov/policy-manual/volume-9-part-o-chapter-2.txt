H2: A. Inadmissibility

Victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons applying for T nonimmigrant status[1]must demonstrate that they are admissible to the United States.[2]This is also true for applicants for derivative T nonimmigrant status.[3]

Applicants for T nonimmigrant status are not subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility.[4]

If an applicant is subject to one or more grounds of inadmissibility, the applicant may apply for a discretionary waiver of the ground(s) by filing an Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant (Form I-192).[5]If the applicable standard is met and a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted, USCIS may waive all inadmissibility grounds for applicants for T nonimmigrant status under eitherINA 212(d)(3)(A)(ii)orINA 212(d)(13), except:

- Espionage or sabotage -INA 212(a)(3)(A)(i)(I);

- Any other security-related unlawful activity -INA 212(a)(3)(A)(ii);

- Overthrow of the U.S. government -INA 212(a)(3)(A)(iii);

- Adverse foreign policy impact -INA 212(a)(3)(C); and

- Participants in Nazi persecution or genocide -INA 212(a)(3)(E)(i)-(ii).[6]

H2: B. Waivers

H3: 1. Waiver Authority

For T nonimmigrant applicants, waivers are available under two sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA):

- INA 212(d)(13), which provides USCIS with discretion to waive grounds of inadmissibility specific to T nonimmigrant status applications; and

- INA 212(d)(3)(A)(ii), which provides USCIS discretion to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility for nonimmigrants based on a general balancing of positive and negative discretionary factors.

The table below outlines common grounds of inadmissibility USCIS encounters for which a waiver is requested under these two legal authorities. If an applicant meets the requirements of the legal standard, the officer must also determine whether to approve the waiver as a matter of discretion.[7]
