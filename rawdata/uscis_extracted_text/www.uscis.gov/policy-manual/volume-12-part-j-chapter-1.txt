H2: A. Purpose

Before becoming a U.S. citizen, an alien eligible for naturalization must take an oath of renunciation and allegiance (Oath of Allegiance) in a public ceremony.[1]The Oath of Allegiance is the culmination of the naturalization process and a crucial act highlighting the transition from immigrant to U.S. citizen. The oath serves as a formal declaration of loyalty and commitment to the United States, its Constitution, and laws.

During the naturalization interview, the alien signs the naturalization application to acknowledge his or her willingness and ability to take the Oath of Allegiance and to accept certain obligations of United States citizenship. The alien must establish that it is his or her intention, in good faith, to assume and discharge the obligations of the Oath of Allegiance.[2]The alien must also establish that his or her attitude toward the Constitution and laws of the United States makes the alien applying for naturalization capable of fulfilling the obligations of the oath.[3]

H2: B. Background

The history of the Oath of Allegiance reflects the dynamic process that has evolved over time. Since the first naturalization law in 1790, aliens applying for naturalization have taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States.[4]Five years later, the Naturalization Act of 1795 required an alien applying to declare an intention (commitment) to become a U.S. citizen before filing a Petition for Naturalization.[5]In the declaration of intention, the alien would indicate his understanding that upon naturalization he would take an oath of allegiance to the United States and renounce (give up) any allegiance to a foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty. An alien born with a hereditary title also had to renounce their title or order of nobility.

Under the decentralized system established by the Naturalization Act of 1802, "any court of record" – federal, state, county, or municipal – could naturalize a new American citizen.[6]Prior to 1906, there were as many as 5,000 courts with naturalization jurisdiction, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath. There was little or no guidance on how to apply or administer the law. Some courts simply documented that an alien swore an oath, while other courts chose to write and print their own text for the oath, which the alien would read at the final hearing.

However, in 1905 a Presidential Commission on Naturalization studied naturalization in the United States. They found that U.S. naturalization courts lacked uniformity. They recommended classifying and summarizing naturalization laws into a code (re-codification), the creation of a federal agency to oversee naturalization procedures, and standard forms for all U.S. naturalizations, including a form for the Oath of Allegiance. To institute standardized procedures, Congress passed the Basic Naturalization Act of 1906 and created the Federal Naturalization Service.[7]

The Basic Naturalization Act of 1906 implemented many of the Commission's recommendations, but did not mandate a separate form for the Oath of Allegiance. Instead, the new Declaration of Intention form and Petition for Naturalization form included some of the substance of the oath. At the final hearing the alien still recited a spoken oath adapted from the law. In 1906, the Basic Naturalization Act also added the section of the oath requiring newly naturalized citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.

An official standard text for the Oath of Allegiance did not appear in the regulations until 1929. The standard oath was printed in the Naturalization Rules and Regulations.[8]There was still no separate, federal form for the oath. It was most likely printed on the back of the application form.[9]

Prior to 1946, the Supreme Court had ruled that the language in the oath about supporting and defending the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies implied a promise to bear arms. However, inGirouard v. U.S., decided in 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that the oath of allegiance did not imply a promise to bear arms.[10]A refusal to bear arms was justified on the basis of religious training and beliefs.[11]The Internal Security Act of 1950 added text to the oath of allegiance about bearing arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law.[12]

The last major addition to the Oath of Allegiance was added by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which provided the section of the Oath of Allegiance about performing work of national importance under civilian direction.[13]This amendment reflected the evolving understanding of citizenship obligations in the United States. It acknowledged the potential of civic duty beyond military service for citizens to contribute to the country’s well-being and defense of the nation deemed crucial by the U.S. government.

Under certain circumstances, an alien applying for naturalization may qualify for a modification or waiver of the oath.[14]In such cases, an officer draws a line through the designated modified portions of the oath and the alien is not required to recite the deleted portions.[15]

Aliens applying for naturalization must generally recite the Oath of Allegiance orally during a public ceremony.[16]Merely signing the naturalization application and a copy of the oath does not make the alien a U.S. citizen.

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
