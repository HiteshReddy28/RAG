H2: A. General Eligibility for Spouses Residing in the United States

The spouse of a U.S. citizen who resides in the United States may be eligible for naturalization on the basis of his or her marriage.[1]The spouse must have continuously resided in the United States after becoming a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for at least 3 years immediately preceding the date of filing the naturalization application and must have lived in marital union with his or her citizen spouse for at least those 3 years.

The spouse must establish that he or she meets the following criteria in order to qualify:

- Age 18 or older at the time of filing.

- LPR at the time of filing the naturalization application.

- Continue to be the spouse of the U.S. citizen up until the time the applicant takes the Oath of Allegiance.

- Living in marital union with the citizen spouse for at least 3 years preceding the time of filing the naturalization application (the citizen spouse must have been a U.S. citizen for those 3 years).

- Continuous residence in the United States as an LPR for at least 3 years immediately preceding the date of filing the application and up to the time of naturalization.

- Physically present in the United States for at least 18 months (548 days) out of the 3 years immediately preceding the date of filing the application.

- Living within the state or USCIS district with jurisdiction over the applicant’s place of residence for at least 3 months prior to the date of filing.

- Demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage.

- Demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history and principles and form of government of the United States (civics).

- Demonstrate good moral character for at least 3 years prior to filing the application until the time of naturalization.

- Attachment to the principles of the U.S. Constitution and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States during all relevant periods under the law.

The spouse of a U.S. citizen residing in the United States may also naturalize under the general naturalization provisions for applicants who have been LPRs for at least 5 years.[2]In addition, in some instances the spouse of a member of the U.S. armed forces applying pursuant to INA 319(a) or INA 316(a) may be eligible for any naturalization proceeding abroad, to include interviews, filings, oaths, ceremonies, or other proceedings relating to naturalization.[3]

H2: B. Living in Marital Union for Spouses Residing in the United States

The spouse of a U.S. citizen residing in the United States must have been living in marital union with his or her citizen spouse for at least 3 years immediately preceding the time of filing the naturalization application. This provision requires that the spouse live in marital union with the citizen spouse during the entire period of 3 years before filing.[4]

However, the statute does not require living in marital union for the period between the date of filing the application and the date of naturalization (date applicant takes the Oath of Allegiance). The corresponding regulation conflicts with the statute in stating that the spouse must have been living in marital union with his or her citizen spouse for at least 3 years at the time of the examination on the application, and not at the time of filing.

USCIS follows the language of the statute in requiring living in marital union only up until the time of filing.[5]Accordingly, only the existence of a legally valid marriage is required from the date of filing the application until the time of the applicant’s naturalization.[6]

A person who was a spouse subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by their citizen spouse is exempt from the marital union requirement.[7]

H2: C. 3 Years of Continuous Residence

The spouse of a U.S. citizen residing in the United States must have continuously resided in the United States as an LPR for at least 3 years immediately preceding the date of the filing the application and up to the time of the Oath of Allegiance. Continuous residence involves the applicant maintaining a permanent dwelling place in the United States for the required period of time. The residence is the applicant’s actual dwelling place regardless of his or her intentions to claim it as his or her residence.[8]

H2: D. 18 Months of Physical Presence

The spouse must have been physically present in the United States for at least 18 months (548 days) out of the 3 years immediately preceding the date of filing the application.[9]Physical presence refers to the number of days the applicant must physically be present in the United States during the statutory period up to the date of filing for naturalization.[10]

H2: E. 90-Day Early Filing Provision (INA 334)

The spouse of a U.S. citizen filing for naturalization on the basis of his or her marriage may file the naturalization application up to 90 days before the date he or she would first meet the required 3-year period of continuous residence.[11]Although an applicant may file early and may be interviewed during that period, the applicant is not eligible for naturalization until he or she has satisfied the required 3-year period of residence. All other requirements for naturalization must be met at the time of filing.

USCIS calculates the early filing period by counting back 90 days from the day before the applicant would have first satisfied the continuous residence requirement for naturalization. For example, if the day the applicant would satisfy the 3-year continuous residence requirement for the first time is on June 10, 2010, USCIS will begin to calculate the 90-day early filing period from June 9, 2010.

In cases where an applicant has filed early and the required 3-month period of residence in a state or service district falls within the required 3-year period of continuous residence, jurisdiction is based on the 3-month period immediately preceding the examination on the application (interview).[12]

H2: F. Eligibility for Persons Subjected to Battery or Extreme Cruelty

H3: 1. General Eligibility for Persons Subjected to Battery or Extreme Cruelty

On October 28, 2000, Congress expanded the provision regarding naturalization based on marriage to a U.S. citizen for persons who reside in the United States. The amendments added that any person who obtained LPR status as the spouse, former spouse, or intended spouse[13]of a U.S. citizen who subjected him or her to battery or extreme cruelty may naturalize under this provision.[14]

Specifically, the person must have obtained LPR status based on:

- An approved Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant (Form I-360) as the self-petitioning spouse of an abusive U.S. citizen;

- An approved Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant (Form I-360) as the self-petitioning spouse of an abusive LPR, if the abusive spouse naturalizes after the petition has been approved;[15]or

- Special rule cancellation of removal for battered spouses and children in cases where the applicant was the spouse, or intended spouse of a U.S. citizen, who subjected him or her to battery or extreme cruelty.[16]

A person is also eligible for naturalization under the spousal naturalization provisions if he or she had the conditions on his or her residence removed based on:

- An approved battery or extreme cruelty waiver of the joint filing requirement for Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751), for a conditional permanent resident, if the marriage was entered into in good faith and the spouse was subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by the petitioning citizen or LPR spouse.[17]

H3: 2. Exception to Marital Union and U.S. Citizenship Requirements for Spouses

A person subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by his or her U.S. citizen spouse is exempt from the following naturalization requirements:[18]

- Married to the U.S. citizen spouse at the time of filing the naturalization application;

- Living in marital union with the citizen spouse for at least 3 years at the time of filing the naturalization application; and

- Applicant’s spouse has U.S. citizenship from the time of filing until the time the applicant takes the Oath of Allegiance.[19]

The spouse must meet all other eligibility requirements for naturalization.[20]

H2: G. Application and Evidence

H3: 1. Application for Naturalization (Form N-400)

To apply for naturalization, the applicant must submit an Application for Naturalization (Form N-400) in accordance with the form instructions and with the required fee.[21]The applicant should check the appropriate eligibility option on the naturalization application to indicate that he or she is applying on the basis of marriage to a U.S. citizen.

H3: 2. Evidence of Spouse’s United States Citizenship

Under this provision, the burden is on the applicant to establish that he or she is married and living in marital union with a U.S. citizen.[22]A spouse of a U.S. citizen must submit with the application evidence to establish the U.S. citizenship of his or her spouse.[23]

Evidence of U.S. citizenship may include:

- Certificate of birth in the United States;​

- Department of State Consular Report of Birth Abroad (FS-240);​

- Certificate of Citizenship;​

- Certificate of Naturalization; and​

- Valid and unexpired United States Passport.

If an official civil record cannot be produced, secondary evidence may be accepted on a case-by-case basis. An officer has the right to request an original record if there is doubt as to the authenticity of the record.[24]

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
