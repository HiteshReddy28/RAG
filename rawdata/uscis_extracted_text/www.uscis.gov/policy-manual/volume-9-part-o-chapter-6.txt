H2: A. Approval

If USCIS determines that the applicant is eligible for a waiver and warrants a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS approves the waiver application. Approval notices for waivers of inadmissibility list the specific grounds USCIS waived. Inadmissibility grounds waived in connection with an application for T nonimmigrant status are not considered waived for purposes of any other immigration benefit request or travel-related purpose, except for purposes of adjustment under INA 245(l).[1]

H2: B. Denial

If USCIS determines that the applicant is not eligible for a waiver or does not warrant a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS denies the waiver application and notifies the applicant of the reasons for the denial in writing.

H2: C. Appeal of Waivers

Applicants may not appeal USCIS’ decision to deny a nonimmigrant waiver sought in connection with an application for T nonimmigrant status.[2]However, the applicant may file a motion to reopen or reconsider a denied waiver application using the Notice of Appeal or Motion (Form I-290B).[3]An applicant may file a new waiver application in appropriate cases,[4]such as when there is new evidence relevant to the waiver consideration.

Applicants may appeal USCIS’ decision to deny an application for a waiver of inadmissibility sought in connection with an application to adjust status.[5]USCIS notifies the applicant in writing of the reasons for the denial and of the right to appeal the decision to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO).[6]

H2: D. Revocation of Waivers

USCIS, at any time, may revoke a waiver previously granted as part of the application for T nonimmigrant status or adjustment of status underINA 212(a)orINA 212(d).[7]There is no appeal of a decision to revoke a waiver.[8]
