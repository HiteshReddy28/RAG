H2: A. General Requirements for Conditional Permanent Residents

Since 1986, certain spouses of U.S. citizens have been admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents on a conditional basis for a period of 2 years.[1]In general, a conditional permanent resident (CPR) must jointly file with his or her petitioning spouse a Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence (Form I-751) with USCIS during the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of his or her admission as a CPR in order to remove the conditions.[2]An approval of a petition to remove conditions demonstrates the bona fides of the marital relationship.

In order for USCIS to approve the petition to remove conditions, the CPR must establish that:

- The marriage upon which the CPR admitted to the United States was valid;​

- The marriage has not been terminated; and​

- The marriage was not entered into for purposes of evading the immigration laws of the United States.[3]

In general, USCIS requires that an applicant for naturalization must have an approved petition to remove conditions before an officer adjudicates the naturalization application. However, certain CPRs may be eligible for naturalization without filing a petition or having the conditions removed if applying for naturalization on the basis of:

- Marriage to a U.S. citizen employed abroad; or​

- Qualifying military service.[4]

H2: B. Spouses who Must Have an Approved Petition Prior to Naturalization

In all cases, a CPR applying for naturalization on the basis of marriage must have an approved petition prior to naturalization if the CPR:

- Has a pending petition to remove conditions at the time of filing the Application for Naturalization; or

- Reaches the 90-day period to file the petition to remove conditions prior to taking the Oath of Allegiance.[5]

H3: 1. Spouses who Reach Petition Filing Period Prior to Naturalization

In most cases, the 90-day period for filing the petition to remove conditions will have passed prior to an applicant becoming eligible to apply for naturalization. However, in some cases involving applicants whose citizen spouse is employed abroad and in cases in which a late filing of the petition to remove conditions is permitted, the 90-day filing period will start after filing for naturalization.

Under these circumstances, the applicant must file the petition to remove conditions and the petition must be adjudicated prior to or concurrently with the naturalization application.

H3: 2. Spouses with Pending Petitions and Naturalization Applications

An application for naturalization may not be approved if there is a pending petition for removal of conditions. If an applicant’s petition to remove conditions is pending at the time of filing or is filed prior to the interview, USCIS will adjudicate the petition to remove conditions prior to or concurrently with the adjudication of the naturalization application.[6]

H3: 3. Failure to File or Denial of the Petition to Remove Conditions

The CPR status of an applicant is terminated and he or she must be placed into removal proceedings if:

- The applicant fails to file the petition to remove conditions; or​

- If the petition to remove conditions is filed, but the petition is denied.[7]

H2: C. Spouses Eligible to Naturalize without Filing Petition to Remove Conditions

H3: 1. Conditional Residents Filing on the Basis of Qualifying Military Service

Applicants for naturalization who qualify on the basis of honorable military service in periods of hostilities may be naturalized whether or not they have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.[8]For this reason, such applicants are not required to comply with all of the requirements for admission to the United States, including the requirements for removal of conditions.

Accordingly, CPRs who are filing on the basis of such qualifying military service are not required to file a petition to remove conditions and may be naturalized without the removal of conditions from their permanent resident status.

H3: 2. Conditional Residents Filing as the Spouse of a U.S. Citizen Employed Abroad

A spouse of a U.S. citizen employed abroad based on authorized employment is not required to have any specific period of residence or physical presence in order to naturalize.[9]Consequently, a CPR spouse is not required to file the petition to remove conditions if the spouse files his or her naturalization application before he or she reaches the 90-day filing period to remove the conditions on residence.[10]

A CPR spouse of a U.S. citizen employed abroad may naturalize without filing a petition to remove conditions if:

- The CPR spouse has been a CPR for less than 1 year and 9 months; and

- The CPR spouse does not reach the 90-day filing period for the petition to remove conditions prior to the final adjudication of his or her naturalization application or the time of the Oath of Allegiance.[11]

Even though the CPR spouse is not required to file the petition to remove conditions, he or she must satisfy the substantive requirements for removal of the conditions.[12]Therefore, the CPR spouse must establish that:

- The marriage was entered into in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage occurred;

- The marriage has not been judicially annulled or terminated;

- The marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring his or her admission as an immigrant; and

- No fee or other consideration was given (other than attorney's fees) for filing the immigrant or fiancé(e) visa petition that forms the basis for admission to the United States.[13]

An officer must not approve a CPR spouse’s naturalization application unless the spouse meets these requirements.[14]

H2: D. Conditional Permanent Residents Admitted as Investors

If a CPR spouse is admitted as an investor, or the spouse or child of an investor,[15]USCIS will make a determination on the CPR’s petition to remove conditions before approving the CPR’s naturalization application.

H2: Appendices

Before October 29, 2019, USCIS considered children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees, who were stationed outside of the United States, to meet the requirement of “is residing in” the United States for the purpose of acquiring citizenship underINA 320.[1]This interpretation was consistent with the definition of “residence” for purposes of naturalization underINA 316.[2]Based on this treatment of U.S. government employees and their children in the context of naturalization under INA 316, USCIS determined that “residing in the United States” for purposes of acquisition of citizenship under INA 320 should likewise be interpreted to include children of U.S. military and government employees stationed outside of the United States who were residing with their parents.[3]

This interpretation, however, was inconsistent with other provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including the definition of “residence” atINA 101(a)(33)and language inINA 322(a)andINA 322(d), which suggested that the citizenship of military children residing outside of the United States should be considered under that provision rather than under INA 320. Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.[4]

On March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,[5]amending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.

The amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.

H3: Footnotes

[^ 1]Even though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship underINA 322since he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements underINA 320as well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.

[^ 2]For example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government. SeeINA 316(b). SeeINA 316(a). See Part D, General Naturalization Requirements, Chapter 3, Continuous Residence [12 USCIS-PM D.3].
