H2: EB-5 Communication Protocols

On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed into law theEB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. Among other things, Sec. 107 of theEB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022codified many of the same restrictions from theEthics and Integrity: Protocols for Processing of EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Petitions and EB-5 Regional Center Applications, Including Stakeholder Communications, which were issued by the secretary of homeland security in 2015. The act mandates that DHS employees act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any entity, organization, or individual in connection with any aspect of the EB-5 program, and -- as was done under the 2015 Ethics and Integrity Protocols-- certain DHS and USCIS employees must take theEB-5 Ethics and Integrity Protocols Training.

The act also mandates certain channels and offices for industry stakeholders, petitioners, applicants, and seekers of benefits under the EB-5 program to use for communicating with DHS about specific EB-5 cases and about non-case-specific EB-5 concerns. (Except for communication made by applicants and petitioners pursuant to regular adjudicatory procedures.) These channels and offices are:

- Email touscis.immigrantinvestorprogram@uscis.dhs.gov;

- TheUSCIS Contact Center;

- USCIS Office of Public Engagement; and

- TheOffice of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman.
