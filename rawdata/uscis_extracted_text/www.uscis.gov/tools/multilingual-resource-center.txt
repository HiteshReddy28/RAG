H1: Multilingual Resource Center

This page offers information in several languages on a variety of naturalization-related topics such as citizenship, Green Cards, employee verification, biometrics, how to report fraud and avoid immigration scams, and humanitarian programs. These resources are also available in American Sign Language, braille, and large print.

We translate our materials into other languages to help people with limited English skills understand immigration benefit services, thus increasing efficiency and accuracy of adjudications. If there are differences between English and another language, the English version is the official version. To learn more, see ourAccuracy and Translation Disclaimer.
