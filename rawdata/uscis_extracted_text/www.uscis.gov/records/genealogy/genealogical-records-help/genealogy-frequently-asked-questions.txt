- Visa Files, July 1, 1924 to March 31, 1944;

- Registry Files, March 1929 to March 31, 1944; and

Send your questions about index search results or record copies that you have already received togenealogy.uscis@dhs.gov. Include your case identification number in the subject line and in your message.

Yes. If you do not have the appropriate file number then you will need to perform anIndex Search.Find moreinformation about file numbers.

We try to respond to all requests within 90 days. However, processing delays sometimes occur. See therequest statuspage to learn more about how you can gauge the progress of your request or make a status inquiry.

No.We can only provide a photocopy of a naturalization record.

If you need only a copy of the naturalization certificate (not certified) to satisfy requirements for your foreign application for dual citizenship, you may submitForm G-1041A, Genealogy Records Requestfor the naturalization certificate only. This can eliminate processing delay resulting from information about the immigrant's children that may require review under the Privacy Act. To request only the certificate, write "Dual Citz-Natz Certificate Only" on yourForm G-1041Aor type this information in the "Optional Information Section" of your online request.

See ourMake a Genealogy Requestwebpage.

At a minimum, you must provide the immigrant’s:

1. Full name (including variant spellings and/or aliases);2. Date of birth (If you don’t have the exact month and/or day, the year is needed); and3. Country of birth.

If possible, also provide information on where the immigrant lived in the United States (For example, "lived in NY in 1920's, then in CT in 1930 to death.") Other information can be helpful, such as names of family members (particularly spouses and children), marriage dates, and military service.

We will send a report of search results for all Index Search Requests. Search results vary. A typical index search response will include a file number, information about the file series, and additional information as follows:

“No Record” | A “no record” response means we couldn’t find anything in the index that matches the information provided in the request. Some "no record" responses will result from an inability to identify an immigrant among the millions of index entries. This occurs when:The request is to search a very common name; orThe request provides little or no additional information to help us identify one immigrant from another.

A “no record” response means we couldn’t find anything in the index that matches the information provided in the request. Some "no record" responses will result from an inability to identify an immigrant among the millions of index entries. This occurs when:

- The request is to search a very common name; or

- The request provides little or no additional information to help us identify one immigrant from another.

To request a record, you must identify the file by the:

- Correct file number; and

- Name of the immigrant named in the record.

In return, we will send you the best possible copy of the requested record. File numbers may be learned from anIndex Search Requestor, in some cases, through independent research.  There are four series of file numbers corresponding to thefive series of filesavailable through a records request:

* When in doubt about a file number, please submit anIndex Search Request. There is no refund when the file corresponding to the file number provided in a Records Request does not match the immigrant's name provided.

- Access theonline ordering system

- Choose the third option, Record Request without Request Case ID;

C-File numberfor a naturalization or citizenship certificate file, 1906-1956. These numbers are found on original certificates and occasionally on other documents.More about C-File series.

Alien Registration Number(A-Number) for a Form AR-2 and/or an A-File numbered below 8 million. These seven-digit numbers may be found among an immigrant's personal papers, or after about 1942 on some court naturalization papers.More about A-Number series.

Important: Form AR-2 is only available for A-Numbers 1 million to 5,980,116; A6,100,000 to 6,132,126; A7 000,000 to 7,043 999, and A7 500,000 to 7,759,142.

Visa File numberfor a Visa File. These numbers were assigned internally by the immigration agency and are not available outside an index search request. Note: Visa File numbersdo not appear on a ship passenger list.More about Visa File series.

Registry File number(R-number) for a Registry File. Some Registry File numbers are found on land border card manifests now available on National Archives microfilm. Occasionally a researcher will find an immigrant's Certificate of Registry or Certificate of Lawful Entry among personal papers, and those cards may or may not include the R-number. The majority of Registry File numbers will only be available through an Index Search Request.More about R-number series.

* When in doubt about a file number, please submit anIndex Search Request. There is no refund when the file corresponding to the file number provided in a records request does not match the immigrant's name provided.

You must provide documentary proof of death with your request if the subject of your request was born less than 100 years before the date of your request.

Acceptable documentary proof includes any of the following:

- Photocopy of Death Certificate;

- U.S. Social Security Death Index record (individual record only, no lists);

- Printed obituary, funeral program, or photograph of gravestone;

- Bible, church, or other religious death record;

- Record relating to the payment of death benefits; and

- Other documents demonstrating the individual is deceased.

Please submit copies of these records with your request.Do not submit original documents as we will not return them to you.

This depends on the records you seek. Submit a genealogy request if you are requesting records of an immigrant who:

- Naturalized before April 1, 1956; or

- Arrived before 1945.

Anyone searching for records of a naturalization on or after April 1, 1956, or an arrival after May 1, 1951, should submit a FOIA request.

If the record you seek falls between 1944-1956, completeForm G-1041, Genealogy Index Search Request, and then we will identify the proper records and provide you with instructions for requesting them under FOIA. Similarly, if a FOIA request identifies records covered by the USCIS Genealogy Program, the FOIA program will provide instructions for requesting those records usingForm G-1041A.

FOIA requests of an obviously genealogical nature (such as for an immigrant born more than 100 years from the date of your request, naturalized prior to 1956, etc.) will be returned to the requester with instructions for re-submitting the request through the USCIS Genealogy Program.

Send updates or corrections to ourGenealogy Mailbox. Include your Case ID number in the subject line and additional information in the body of the email.

You can find the filing fee for Form G-1041 and G-1041A by visiting ourFee Schedulepage.

The fee is effective for filings postmarked April 1, 2024, and later.

You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier’s check, or pay by credit or debit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions.  If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Online Requests– When making your request online, you will be redirected to the Department of the Treasury's pay.gov service. Here you can pay by credit, debit, pre-paid card or bank withdrawal. Once the transaction is complete, you will receive a printable receipt showing your new USCIS Genealogy Case number. You can choose to pay the fee by mail (see below), but the request will not be processed until the fee is received.

Mailed Requests- When mailing your request, you can pay with a money order, personal or cashier's check, or credit or debit card by submittingForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions. Submit the fee withForm G-1041orForm G-1041A. If you mail your request without payment then we will hold your request and contact you to submit the fee. If we don’t receive your payment within 30 days from when you submitted the request, we will cancel the request.

If you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.

There are no refunds for a search request where no records are located, or when the file located falls under the purview of the USCIS Freedom of Information/Privacy Act program and/or the National Archives.

There are also no refunds for a records request where the file number provided is invalid, or where proof of death is required and is not received within 30 days of receipt of the request.

No refunds or returns will be honored for user errors or in the event of an application cancellation or withdrawal request.

You can find naturalization records from before Sept. 27, 1906, in federal, state, or local/municipal court records. Only the naturalization court kept records of naturalizations before that date. Naturalization practices and procedures also varied greatly over time and geographical location. As a result, local sources usually provide the best information on how to find pre-1906 naturalization records. For more information on state and local courts, contact the state or county historical or genealogical society in the location where you believe the immigrant naturalized. For federal court records, contact theNational Archives and Records Administration.

For more information on arrival and nationality records dated prior to Sept. 27, 1906, visit ourResearch Guidancepage.

For any USCIS records not included within the scope of our and not covered by any other rule or request form, file aFreedom of Information Act or Privacy Act Request.

TheNational Archives and Records Administrationnow maintains land, sea, and air manifests dated before December 1982.

Individuals admitted to the United States as contracted agricultural laborers between 1942 and 1951, and between 1951 and 1965, were admitted temporarily as nonimmigrants. USCIS did not retain records of temporary admissions. Lawfully admitted Braceros who fulfilled their contracts and returned to Mexico may not appear in any USCIS record.

Braceros who later immigrated to or adjusted to another status in the United States will in most cases have a USCIS file. However, that file may or may not contain any documentation of the immigrant’s former status as a Bracero.

Where and How to Submit Requests:

If the Bracero is living, submit your request through:

USCIS FOIA/PA Request

- www.uscis.gov/foia

- Form G-639, Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Request (don't send money)

If the Bracero is deceased, submit your request through:

USCIS Genealogy Index Search Request

- www.uscis.gov/genealogy

- Form G-1041 or submit online (Fee Schedule)

If the Bracero was born less than 100 years before the date of your request, proof of death is required. Write “Bracero” in the comments section. We will search all indices to identify any matching record and:

- If we don’t find the record then we will reply with a letter of “no record;” or

- If we find the record then we will reply with instructions on how to request it.
