H2: Quick Tips

- If you know about the immigrant, but do not know the immigrant's file number(s), choose to make anIndex SearchRequest. You may also want to consider a preliminaryIndex Searchsince one person may have multiple records and/or file numbers.Be sure to include all possible names. If you have more than one name or name spelling for the immigrant, first enter the name you think is correct when filling out theIndex SearchRequest. Later add alternate spellings in the "Optional Information" section.If you have only an approximate birthdate (or multiple birthdates) for the immigrant, provide an estimated date of birth. The online form asks for an exact date of birth and then asks you if the date given is an estimate. If you can only provide an approximate year, enter January 1 as the birthdate (e.g., 01/01/XXXX) and check the "estimated" box. Later, in the "Other Biographical Information" section, you can provide alternate birth dates.If you enter an estimated date of birth, the system will alert you that proof of the immigrant's death may be necessary. If you know the date of birth is more than 100 years ago (for example, an estimated birth year of 1878), you will not have to provide any proof of death. If you estimate 1912 the system may accept your request without proof. However, if we determine the immigrant was born less than 100 years ago you will be contacted and asked for proof of death before records or information can be released. For more information about acceptable proofs of death, seeGenealogy FAQs.A separateIndex Searchrequest is required for each individual immigrant. Requests for related immigrants cannot be combined and you will only receive index search results for the subject of your request.
