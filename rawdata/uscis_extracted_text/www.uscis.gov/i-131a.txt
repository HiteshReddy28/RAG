If you are an LPR with an expired Green Card

If you have an expired Green Card, you may not need to file Form I-131A. Although regulations generally require an LPR to travel with a valid Green Card, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policy allows a transportation carrier bound for the United States to let you board without carrier documentation if you are:

- An LPR with an expired Green Card that was issued with a 10-year expiration date, and you have been outside the United States for less than 1 year;

- An LPR with an expired Green Card with a 2-year expiration date, and you also have Form I-797, Notice of Action, showing that you filedForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, orForm I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status, and you have been outside the United States for less than 1 year. The Notice of Action extends the validity of the card for a specified length of time; or

- An LPR military service member or employee of the U.S. government (or an LPR dependent of such an individual) on official U.S. military or government travel orders, regardless of time outside the United States.

Check with your airline or transportation carrier before you file Form I-131A. In some situations, they may refuse to let you board even if you are in one of the categories above. In that case, you will need to file Form I-131A.

If you have a child who was born outside the United States, you may need to request carrier documentation if:

- You are an LPR or have an immigrant visa;

- Your child is under 2 years old; and

- Your child is traveling with you to come to the United States for the first time.

We recommend checking with your airline or transportation carrier first to ensure they will board your child in these circumstances without carrier documentation. If the airline or transportation carrier refuses to board your child without carrier documentation, you will need to pay for and submit a Form I-131A for your child.

If you were issued a Form I-512T, Travel Authorization Document, that has been lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed, mark Box 1.e. or Box 1.f. in Section 2 of Form I-131A.
