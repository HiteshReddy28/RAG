H1: Green Card for an Informant (S Nonimmigrant)

An S nonimmigrant is an individual who has assisted a law enforcement agency as a witness or informant.

A law enforcement agency may submit an application for permanent residence (a Green Card) on behalf of a witness or informant when the individual has completed the terms and conditions of his or her S classification. Only a federal or state law enforcement agency or a U.S. Attorney’s office may submit a request for permanent residence as an S nonimmigrant on behalf of a witness or informant. The requesting agency must also be the same agency that initially requested S nonimmigrant status on behalf of the individual.

Qualifying family members of the principal S nonimmigrant may also be eligible to apply for a Green Card.

H2: Application Process

S nonimmigrants must go through a two step process to apply for a Green Card.

- Step One– FileForm I-854, Interagency Alien Witness and Informant Record.

This form is to be completed by the federal or state law enforcement agency or U.S. Attorney’s Office that initially filed for the S nonimmigrant status on behalf of the individual.

Evidence that the witness or informant has fulfilled his or her obligations as an S nonimmigrant and provided information about all potential grounds of inadmissibility must be included with the completed and signed Form I-854 application. Failure to disclose all grounds of inadmissibility may result in the alien being removed (deported) from the United States. For more information on the grounds of inadmissibility for S visa nonimmigrants, please see the Form I-854 instructions.

- Step Two– After Form I-854 is approved, fileForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.

Applicants should check box “h” in part 2 of the I-485 application and write “S Nonimmigrant” or “S-Qualified Family Member” on the line next to box “h.”
