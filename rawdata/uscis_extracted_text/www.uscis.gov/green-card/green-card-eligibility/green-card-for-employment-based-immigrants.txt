H1: Green Card for Employment-Based Immigrants

U.S. immigration law provides aliens with a variety of ways to become lawful permanent residents (get a Green Card) through employment in the United States. These employment-based (EB) “preference immigrant” categories include:

- First preference (EB-1)– priority workersAliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics;Outstanding professors and researchers; orCertain multinational managers and executives.

- Aliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics;

- Outstanding professors and researchers; or

- Certain multinational managers and executives.

- Second preference (EB-2)– aliens who are members of the professions holding advanced degrees or who have exceptional ability (including requests for national interest waivers).

- Third preference (EB-3)– skilled workers, professionals, or other workers.

- Aliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics;

- Outstanding professors and researchers; or

- Certain multinational managers and executives.

This page provides specific information for aliens in the United States who want to apply for lawful permanent resident status in the EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories while in the United States. This is called “adjustment of status.” You should also read theInstructions for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Statusbefore you apply.

For more information on other types of employment-based immigrants, see our pages on Green Cards forEB-4 special immigrants(for example, religious workers and special immigrant juveniles) andEB-5 immigrant investors.

Inspected and Admitted or Inspected and Paroled

Generally, to be eligible to adjust status, you must be present in the United States after being “inspected and admitted” or “inspected and paroled” by an immigration officer. There are some limited exceptions to this eligibility requirement. For more information on this requirement, see USCIS Policy ManualVolume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, Chapter 2, Section A, “Inspected and Admitted” or “Inspected and Paroled”.

Eligibility to Receive an Immigrant Visa

You are eligible to receive an immigrant visa, if you are the beneficiary of:

- An approved Form I-140 filed on your behalf;

- A pending Form I-140 (that is ultimately approved); or

- A Form I-485 filed together with the Form I-140 (and the Form I-140 is ultimately approved).

Depending on how you entered the United States or if you committed a particular act or violation of immigration law, you may be barred from adjusting status. You are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if one or more bars to adjustment listed insection 245(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)apply to you. For more information, please seeUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, 245(a) Adjustment.

Applying Under INA 245(i) (LIFE Act)

You may be able to adjust status under INA245(i)even if you are subject to one or more adjustment bars and are therefore ineligible for adjustment of status under INA245(a). See the separateInstructions for Form I-485 Supplement A, Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i)for more information.

To qualify for a Green Card, you must be admissible to the United States. Reasons why you may be inadmissible are listed in theINA 212(a)and are called grounds of inadmissibility.

In general, USCIS can only approve your Green Card application only if none of the grounds of inadmissibility apply to you.

If you are inadmissible, the law may allow you to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief in your situation. SeeForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of InadmissibilityandForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States after Deportation or Removal. If a waiver or other form of relief is granted, USCIS may approve your application for a Green Card if you are otherwise eligible.

Whether a waiver or other form of relief is available depends on the specific inadmissibility ground(s) that applies to you and the category you are adjusting under. Eligibility requirements for waivers and other forms of relief vary. For information on the grounds of inadmissibility and waivers, please see USCIS Policy ManualVolume 8, AdmissibilityandVolume 9, Waivers.

If you are currently in the United States, an immigrant visa is immediately available to you as an EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant, and you meet certain other requirements, you may fileForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to apply for a Green Card without leaving the country. This is called “adjustment of status.” If a visa is immediately available, you may file your Form I-485:

- Together (“concurrently”) withForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workerfiled on your behalf;

- While the Form I-140 is pending; or

- After the Form I-140 is approved (and remains valid).

You may be eligible, using the new mailing address below, to request to transfer the underlying basis of yourForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to a different employment-based immigrant category based on anotherForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers.

USCIS may, in its discretion, grant a transfer request if the following criteria are met:

- You have continuously maintained eligibility for adjustment of status;

- Your adjustment of status application based on the original Form I-140 is still pending;

- You are eligible for the new immigrant category; and

- You have a visa immediately available in the new immigrant category.

You must request in writing that USCIS transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to another immigrant category.

In certain instances, you should also submit a completedI-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Valid Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j)with your transfer request. The purpose of the Supplement J is to confirm the validity of the job offered to you in the immigrant petition you want to use as the basis for your transfer request.

- If you are requesting to transfer your underlying basis to a previously filed and approved Form I-140, you should submit Supplement J with your transfer request.

- If you are requesting to transfer your underlying basis to a Form I-140 that remains pending, you do not need to submit Supplement J.

- If a new Form I-140 is being filed on your behalf and you are eligible to concurrently file, you may request to transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to this new petition. The petition must be submitted with a signed letter requesting that your pending Form I-485 be transferred to the new petition. It should include a coversheet (preferably highlighted with colored paper) stating “REQUEST FOR TRANSFER OF PENDING FORM I-485 [receipt number] TO ENCLOSED PETITION.”  You should include a copy of the Form I-485 receipt notice as well as evidence of eligibility in the new immigrant category. You do not need to submit Supplement J.

USCIS does not provide a written response to transfer requests. However, USCIS will issue receipt notices for the Supplement J.

The written request to transfer the underlying basis should at a minimum contain sufficient information for USCIS to identify the pending Form I-485 and the immigrant petition which you would like to use as the new basis for your application (for example, receipt number or A-Number).
