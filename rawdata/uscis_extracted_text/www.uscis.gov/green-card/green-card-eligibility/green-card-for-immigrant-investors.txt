H1: Green Card for Immigrant Investors

U.S. immigration law allows certain aliens who are employment-based immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (get a Green Card). One employment-based (EB) “preference immigrant” category includes aliens who have invested or are actively in the process of investing $1,050,000 (or $800,000 in a targeted employment area or infrastructure project) in a new commercial enterprise that will benefit the U.S. economy and create at least 10 full-time positions for qualifying employees. These aliens are also called “EB-5 immigrant investors” because they are in the employment-based fifth preference visa category. See theEB-5 Immigrant Investor Programfor more information about this visa category.

This page has information specifically for aliens in the United States who want to apply for lawful permanent resident status as EB-5 immigrant investors while in the United States. This is called “adjustment of status.”You should also read theInstructions for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Statusbefore you apply.

If you are currently outside the United States, seeConsular Processingfor information on how to apply for a Green Card as an EB-5 immigrant investor.

If you are currently in the United States,in order to be eligible for a Green Card as an EB-5 immigrant investor, you must meet the following requirements:

- You properly filedForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status;

- You were inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled into the United States;

- You are physically present in the United States at the time you file your Form I-485;

- You are eligible to receive an immigrant visa based on an approvedForm I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur;

- An immigrant visa is immediately available to you at the time you file your Form I-485 and at the time USCIS makes a final decision on your application. (For information on visa availability, seeVisa Availability and Priority Dates,Adjustment of Status Filing Charts, and the Department of State website to view theVisa Bulletin.)

- None of the applicable bars to adjustment of status apply to you;

- You are admissible to the United States for lawful permanent residence or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief; and

- You merit the favorable exercise ofUSCIS’ discretion.

H2: Inspected and Admitted or Inspected and Paroled

Generally, to be eligible to adjust status, you must be present in the United States after being “inspected and admitted” or “inspected and paroled” by an immigration officer. There are some limited exceptions to this eligibility requirement. For more information on this requirement, see USCIS Policy ManualVolume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, Chapter 2, Section A, “Inspected and Admitted” or “Inspected and Paroled”.

Depending on how you entered the United States or if you committed a particular act or violation of immigration law, you may be barred from adjusting status. You are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if one or more bars to adjustment listed insection 245(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)apply to you.  For more information, please seeUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, 245(a) Adjustment.

Applying Under INA 245(i)

You may be able to adjust status under INA245(i)even if you are subject to one or more adjustment bars and are therefore ineligible for adjustment of status under INA245(a). See the separateInstructions for Form I-485 Supplement A, Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i)for more information.

To qualify for a Green Card, you must be admissible to the United States. Reasons why you may be inadmissible are listed inINA 212(a)and are called grounds of inadmissibility.

In general, USCIS can only approve your Green Card application if none of the grounds of inadmissibility apply to you.

If you are inadmissible, the law may allow you to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief. SeeForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of InadmissibilityandForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal. If a waiver or other form of relief is granted, USCIS may approve your application for a Green Card if you are otherwise eligible.

Whether a waiver or other form of relief is available depends on the specific inadmissibility ground(s) that applies to you and the category under which you are adjusting. Eligibility requirements for waivers and other forms of relief vary. For information on the grounds of inadmissibility and waivers, please see USCIS Policy ManualVolume 8, Admissibility, andVolume 9, Waivers.

If an immigrant visa is immediately available to you and you are currently in the United States, you may be eligible to fileForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to apply for a Green Card without leaving the country. Review the Eligibility for Adjustment of Status part of this page to determine if you are eligible to adjust status in the United States.

If an immigrant visa is immediately available to you, you may file Form I-485 together with your Form I-526, while your Form I-526 is pending, or after your Form I-526 is approved.
