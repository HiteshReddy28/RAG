ALERT:In January, 2023, USCIS extended the validity of Permanent Resident Cards (also known as Green Cards) for petitioners who properly fileForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, orForm I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Statusfor 48 months beyond the card’s expiration date. Read more here:USCIS Extends Green Card Validity for Conditional Permanent Residents with a Pending Form I-751 or Form I-829.

Your permanent residence status is conditional if it is based on investment. You receive conditional resident status on the day you are lawfully admitted to the United States for a two-year period.

To remove the conditions on your permanent resident status, you must fileForm I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions, within the 90-day period before your Green Card expires.

For more information, see theEB-5 Investors page, 8 CFR 216.6, the Form I-829 Instructions, andVolume 6, Part G of the USCIS Policy Manual.

H2: After You File

We will extend your conditional permanent resident status for six months, or until we finish processing your Form I-829, whichever is longer. You will receive a receipt for filing your Form I-829 that you should carry with your Green Card.

H2: If You Don’t File

If you do not file Form I-829 as required, you will automatically lose your conditional permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of the date you were granted conditional status. As a result, you will become removable from the United States.

H2: Filing Late

You may file Form I-829 late if you submit a:

- Request to excuse your late filing; and

- Written explanation showing your failure to file on time was for good cause and due to extenuating circumstances.
