H1: Minor Eligibility Attestation

As a prospective parolee, DHS wants to ensure you are aware of the eligibility requirements for children under the age of 18.

Children who are under the age of 18 may only be eligible for parole if they are traveling to the United States with and in the care and custody of their parent or legal guardian. Parents or legal guardians traveling with a minor child should be prepared to provide documentation of their relationship to the child upon arrival to the United States. If this proof is not available, for the protection and welfare of the child, U.S. law may require that the child be placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Generally, evidence of legal guardianship requires that a legal or administrative process involving the courts or other recognized government entity take place (i.e., a power of attorney or written and/or notarized statement is not a formally recognized arrangement).

Please complete the below attestation to certify your understanding of the family relationship requirement for children requesting parole.

- I understand that only minors (under the age of 18) traveling with and in the care and custody of a parent or legal guardian are eligible for parole.

- If I travel with a child of whom I am the parent or legal guardian, I am able to provide documentation as evidence of my parental relationship or legal guardianship of the child. Evidence may include a birth certificate for the child, and identity documents for the parent or legal guardian. Generally, evidence of legal guardianship requires that a legal or administrative process involving the courts or other recognized government entity take place (i.e., a power of attorney or written and/or notarized statement is not a formally recognized arrangement).

- If I travel with a child of whom I am not the parent or legal guardian, then it is possible that upon arrival at the United States Port of Entry, the child will be referred to the Department of Health and Human Services as an unaccompanied child.
