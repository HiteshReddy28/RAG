ALERT:On Feb. 27, 2024, weannounceda process for eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to apply for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States.

We encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole. You can find your parole expiration date on yourForm I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States.

Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request.If you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees. Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision.

If you file Form I-765 before we grant re-parole, we may deny your Form I-765, and we will not refund any associated fees.

When you submit Form I-765 for a renewal EAD, you must include either the filing fee or a completedForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver. If you are submitting a fee waiver request with Form I-765, you must file on paper by mail. You cannot apply online if you are submitting a fee waiver request. Parolees are encouraged to file Form I-765 as soon as we approve their re-parole application.

Parolees who are granted re-parole and whose “Most Recent Date of Entry” was on or before Sept. 30, 2024, will be able to show a new, unexpired Form I-94 with “UHP” class of admission and “Most Recent Date of Entry” of Sept. 30, 2024, or earlier as acceptable evidence of identity and employment authorization for a period of up to 90 days from the date of hire (or for reverification, when employment authorization expires). Within 90 days, the employee must present an unexpired EAD or unrestricted Social Security card and a List B identity document such as a state-issued driver’s license or identification card to meet the Form I-9 requirements.

You will need a Social Security number for employment, to collect Social Security benefits, and to receive other government services. If you did not complete Form I-765 and did not answer “Yes” to both Item Number 14 and Item Number 15 allowing USCIS to disclose your personal information on Form I-765, you will need to apply for a Social Security number and card using the instructions at the Social Security Administration’sRequest Social Security number for the first timewebpage.
