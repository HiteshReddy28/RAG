H2: What is Form N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship?

Form N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship, is filed to obtain aCertificate of Citizenshipwhich serves as evidence of your or your child’s U.S. citizenship. You may file Form N-600 if you were born abroad and are claiming U.S. citizenship at birth through your parents. You may also file Form N-600 to obtain evidence of citizenship if you automatically became a U.S. citizen by operation of law after your birth but before you turned 18 years of age. A parent or guardian may also file Form N-600 on behalf of a minorchild.

Please note that USCIS does not issue Certificates of Citizenship in cases where the person became a U.S. citizen based on birth in the United States. USCIS only issues Certificates of Citizenship to those individuals who were born abroad but are U.S. citizens at birth through their parents, or who became citizens after birth but before the age of 18.

H2: General Questions

H3: My U.S. citizen parent(s) is deceased. Does this affect my ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship?

No. Your parent’s death does not affect your ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship if you automatically acquired citizenship, either at birth or after birth, before your parent’s death. However, if you did not automatically acquire citizenship before your parent’s death, your parent’s death may affect your ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship unless you meet the requirements of section 322 of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA). Please note that section 322 of the INA does not provide for automatic citizenship, but it does allow for naturalization before the age of 18 and allows you to rely on your grandparent’s physical presence instead of your parent’s physical presence.

H3: I am claiming citizenship through my mother. My parents were not married at the time of my birth. Does this affect whether I automatically acquired citizenship?

It may. You acquired U.S. citizenship at the time of your birth if you were born out of wedlock after Dec. 23, 1952 and your U.S. citizen mother was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for at least one year prior to your birth. The requirements before Dec. 23, 1952 varied to some extent. If you have specific questions before that time period, please contact theUSCIS Contact Centerat 800-375-5283. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833.

If you are claiming U.S. citizenship after birth, your birth out of wedlock may affect your ability to acquire citizenship through your mother depending on when you turned 18 years of age.

- If you were over 18 years of age on Feb. 27, 2001, and you were born out of wedlock, you generally could only acquire citizenship after birth through your mother if your paternity had not been established by legitimation.

- If you were under 18 years of age on Feb. 27, 2001, or were born after that date, you can acquire U.S. citizenship through your U.S. citizen mother regardless of whether you were born out of wedlock if, before you turn 18, your mother is a citizen and you are residing in the U.S. based on a lawful admission for permanent residence in the legal and physical custody of your U.S. citizen mother.

H3: I am a U.S. citizen who gave birth to a child abroad using a donated egg and sperm. Is my child a citizen?

Maybe. If you are recognized by the relevant jurisdiction as the legal mother at the time of birth under the law of the relevant jurisdiction and you meet all the other requirements (such as the required years of U.S. residence), non-genetic gestational mothers may transmit citizenship to their children.

H3: I am claiming U.S. citizenship through my father.  My parents were not married at the time of my birth.  Does this affect whether I automatically acquired citizenship?

It may. If you were born out of wedlock, are claiming that you acquired U.S. citizenship at the time of your birth, and you were born after Nov. 14, 1986, you must demonstrate:

- That your father was physically present in the United States for 5 years, at least 2 of which were after 14 years of age;

- A blood relationship with your father by clear and convincing evidence;

- That your father was a U.S. citizen at the time of your birth;

- That your father (unless deceased) has agreed in writing to provide financial support for you until you reach 18 years of age;and

- While you are under 18 years of ageYou are legitimated under the law of your residence or domicile;Your father acknowledges paternity of you in writing under oath;orYour paternity is established by a court.

- You are legitimated under the law of your residence or domicile;

- Your father acknowledges paternity of you in writing under oath;or

- Your paternity is established by a court.

- You are legitimated under the law of your residence or domicile;

- Your father acknowledges paternity of you in writing under oath;or

- Your paternity is established by a court.

If you were born out of wedlock, are claiming that you acquired U.S. citizenship at the time of your birth, and you were born between Jan. 13, 1941 and Nov. 14, 1986, you must establish that your paternity was established by legitimation while you were under the age of 21.

NOTE: If you were at least 15 years of age but under 18 years of age on Nov. 14, 1986, you could choose to have either of the requirements above apply to you.

If you are claiming that you acquired U.S. citizenship after birth through your father and you were born out of wedlock after Feb. 27, 2001, or you were under the age of 18 on that date, you may have acquired U.S. citizenship after birth. You must establish that you were legitimated, or are considered legitimate, that you were residing in the legal and physical custody of your father in the U.S. while you were under the age of 18, and that you were admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

H3: My parents are divorced. Does this affect my ability to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship?

Your parents’ divorce does not affect your ability toapplyfor a Certificate of Citizenship if you automatically acquired citizenship before your parents’ divorce. If, however, your parents’ divorce occurred before you acquired U.S. citizenship, and you are claiming U.S. citizenship after birth, you will generally need to demonstrate that before 18 years of age you resided in the legal and physical custody of your U.S. citizen parent after a lawful admission for permanent residence. If the parent who is a U.S. citizen is not the parent who has legal and physical custody of you, you may not be able to automatically acquire U.S. citizenship.

H3: I do not currently reside in the United States. Am I still eligible for a Certificate of Citizenship?

Persons who acquired U.S. citizenship and reside abroad should seek evidence of citizenship through a passport application to the Department of State. In most cases, one must be living in the United States to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship.

Generally, you cannotautomaticallyacquire citizenship after birth through your parent if you have not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the U.S. However, a parent or legal guardian may be able to apply for naturalization for you under section 322 of the Immigration and Nationality Act if you are under 18 years of age and temporarily present in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission, which includes a lawful admission in non-immigrant status. Please refer toForm N-600K, Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate Under Section 322for more information.

H2: Filing

H3: I already have a U.S. passport issued by the Department of State.  Am I required to file a Form N-600 for a Certificate of Citizenship?

No. You are not required to file a Form N-600 for a Certificate of Citizenship. The Certificate of Citizenship is an optional form. A validly issued U.S. passport generally serves as evidence of your U.S. citizenship during its period of validity unless that passport has been revoked by the Department of State. However, you may be required to submit your Certificate of Citizenship when attempting to apply for certain other benefits, including, but not limited to:

- Social Security benefits

- State issued ID including a Driver’s License or Learning Permit

- Financial Aid

- Employment

- Passport Renewal

H2: Interview

H3: Will I be interviewed?

Not all applicants for a Certificate of Citizenship are required to appear for an in-person interview. USCIS will determine, based on the evidence submitted in support of your application, whether you are required to appear in person for an interview.

H3: What am I required to bring at the time of my interview?

All original documents of the copies you submitted when you filed your Form N-600 as well as any additional documents that will establish your eligibility. Documents not in English must be accompanied by a certified translation.

H3: Is my parent required to accompany me to the interview?

If you are 18 years of age or older, you may appear for your N-600 interview without your U.S. citizen parent. If you are under 18 years of age, you must appear for the interview with your U.S. citizen parent unless USCIS has waived your parent’s appearance per 8 CFR section 341.2.

H2: USCIS Decision

H3: What happens if USCIS approves my Form N-600?

If USCIS approves your Form N-600, USCIS will issue you a Certificate of Citizenship. If you are over 14 years of age, you will be scheduled to appear at a USCIS office to take the Oath of Allegiance if the Oath of Allegiance ceremony is not conducted on the same day as the interview.  If you are under the age of 14, you may not be required to take the Oath of Allegiance.
