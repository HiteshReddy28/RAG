H1: Filing Form I-765 with Other Forms

You can fileForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorizationwith other forms. This is called concurrent filing. In other instances, you may need to wait to file Form I-765. For example, you would need to wait 150 days after filing for asylum if your asylum application remains pending.  Always thoroughly read the instructions related to the benefit for which you are applying to determine whether you may need to wait before you can file for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).

If you are filing Form I-765 with another form, file both forms (with all the required filing fees and supporting documents) at the location specified by the other form (see below). For example, if you are filing Form I-765 together with Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, file both forms according to the Form I-539 instructions. You can find the filing fee for Form I-765 by visiting ourFee Schedulepage.
