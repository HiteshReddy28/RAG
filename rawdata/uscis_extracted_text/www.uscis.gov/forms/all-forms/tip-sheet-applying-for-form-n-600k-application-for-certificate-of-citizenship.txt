When you file Form N-600K, you will provide a preferred interview date. We will need a minimum of 90 days to review the form and the documentation. Therefore, please ensure the preferred interview date you request is at least 90 days before your child turns 18.

If you do not provide sufficient evidence to establish your child’s eligibility before their 18th birthday, we will deny your Form N-600K, and your child would no longer be eligible for a Certificate of Citizenship.
