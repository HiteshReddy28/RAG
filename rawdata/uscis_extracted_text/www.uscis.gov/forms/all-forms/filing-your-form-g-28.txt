H1: Filing Your Form G-28

An attorney or a representative accredited by the Board of Immigration Appeals (legal representative) may represent you before USCIS if you are applying for an immigration benefit or requesting a form of relief with USCIS.

If you want USCIS to communicate with your legal representative about your case, you must submit aForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative. For more information on finding a legal representative, please visit ourFind Legal Servicespage.

When you file Form G-28 (edition date: 05/23/18 and 9/17/18), you can specify your preference for receiving notices and secure documents from USCIS.

If an applicant, petitioner, or requestor submits an application or benefit request with a previous version of Form G-28, we will only accept the application or request as long as it meets the acceptance criteria. In this situation, we will not accept Form G-28 and will send all notices and secure documents back to the applicant/petitioner/requestor.

The 05/23/18 and 9/17/18 editions of Form G-28 allow you to tell us how you would like to receive notices and secure documents.

The chart below summarizes your options:
