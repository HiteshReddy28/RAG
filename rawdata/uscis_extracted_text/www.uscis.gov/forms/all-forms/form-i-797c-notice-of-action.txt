H1: Form I-797C, Notice of Action

H2: What is a Form I-797C?

USCIS will send Form I-797C, Notice of Action, to an applicant/petitioner in order to communicate information related to notices of:

- receipt,

- rejection,

- transfer,

- re-open, and

- appointment (fingerprint, biometric capture, interview, rescheduled).

If you receive a Form I-797C in the mail, please pay close attention to what it says. Ignoring the instructions in a Notice of Action might delay your case.

H2: What Does a Form I-797C look like?

Starting on April 2, 2012, Form I-797C, Notice of Action will:

- be printed on plain paper and

- include a header stating “THIS NOTICE DOES NOT GRANT ANY IMMIGRATION STATUS OR BENEFIT.”

Previous to April 12, 2012, USCIS printed Form I-797Cs with a DHS seal and on more expensive bond paper. We determined that these notices could be printed on plain paper which results in cost savings to the government. In addition, after April 12, 2012, Form I-797Cs will contain the disability accommodation information on the reverse side to reduce paper use. See the press release for more details.

FORM I-797C AFTER 4/2/2012

FORM I-797C BEFORE 4/2/2012

Previous versions of the Form I-797C issued prior to April 12, 2012, remain valid and should be kept for your records.

Does the Form I-797C Grant any Specific Immigration Benefits?

USCIS recognizes that some state, local, public, or private benefit granting agencies may accept Form I-797C as collateral evidence for awarding a benefit they administer. USCIS reminds those agencies that Form I-797C is only a receipt proving an applicant has submitted a benefit request; USCIS has not determined whether that applicant is eligible for an immigration benefit.
