H1: USCIS Extends Green Card Validity for Conditional Permanent Residents with a Pending Form I-751 or Form I-829

USCIS is extending the validity of Permanent Resident Cards (also known as Green Cards) for petitioners who properly fileForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence, orForm I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Statusfor 48 months beyond the cardâ€™s expiration date. This change started on January 11, 2023, for Form I-829 and will start on January 25, 2023, for Form I-751.

We are making this change to accommodate current processing times for Form I-751 and Form I-829, which have increased over the past year.

USCIS has updated the language on Form I-751 and Form I-829 receipt notices to extend the validity of a Green Card for 48 months for individuals with a newly filed Form I-751 or Form I-829. We will issue new receipt notices to eligible conditional permanent residents who previously received notices with an extension shorter than 48 months and whose cases are still pending. These receipt notices can be presented with an expired Green Card as evidence of continued status, while the case remains pending with USCIS. By presenting your updated receipt notice with your expired Green Card, you remain authorized to work and travel for 48 months from the expiration date on the front of your expired Green Card.

As a reminder, conditional permanent residents who plan to be outside of the United States for a year or more should apply for a reentry permit by filingForm I-131, Application for Travel Document, before leaving the United States.
