Beginning Feb. 27, 2024, eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who are physically present in the United States can now be considered for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States. Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members who were paroled into the United States on or after Feb. 11, 2022, can apply for re-parole under this process. As with any parole application, we will consider these applications on a discretionary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the secretary of homeland security exercised his discretionary authority to allow certain Ukrainians to seek temporary parole in the United States, as well as apply for work authorization. The extraordinary circumstances in Ukraine that supported the prior exercise of discretionary parole authority continue to exist. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has continued and has resulted in tremendous civilian casualties. USCIS will take these current extraordinary circumstances into account on a case-by-case basis when we evaluate requests for re-parole. For decades, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have used parole authority on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.

Beginning Feb. 27, 2024, USCIS will accept and consider re-parole applications from certain Ukrainians and their immediate family members paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members may apply for re-parole by submittingForm I-131, Application for Travel Document, along with supporting documentation and the proper filing fee orfee waiver request. You can submit Form I-131 online or on paper by mail.

To be eligible for re-parole under this process, you must demonstrate the following:

- That you are a Ukrainian citizen or their immediate family member who was paroled into the United States on or after Feb. 11, 2022;

- That there are continued urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit for issuance of a new period of parole, including the urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit factors identified above, as well as any additional factors;

- That you warrant a favorable exercise of discretion;

- That you are physically present in the United States as a parolee;

- That you have complied with the conditions of the initial parole; and

- That you clear biographic and biometric background checks.

We encourage you to file your Form I-131 through yourUSCIS online account, instead of on paper. If you do not have a USCIS online account, you can create one at any time by accessing ourHow to Create a USCIS Online Accountwebpage. (See alsoHow to Create a USCIS Online Account in UkrainianandHow to Create a USCIS Online Account in Russian.) Filing online will help you avoid common mistakes such as a missing signature, missing pages, or an incomplete application. We reject some forms filed on paper because of these issues. You can also get case status updates, case history, and access notices we post to your account. You will also have access to the documents you upload to support your case, among other benefits. For more information about online filing, see ourFile Onlinewebpage.

See our newRe-Parole Process for Certain Ukrainianspage for additional information on the process and step-by-step instructions on how to apply for re-parole under this process.

Employment Authorization

If we approve your re-parole application, you may then fileForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, in category (c)(11), to apply for a new Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as proof of employment authorization consistent with your re-parole period. You may file Form I-765 either online or on paper. You can use your USCIS Online Account to file Form I-765. Do not file Form I-765 before you receive a re-parole approval notice. If you file Form I-765 before we approve your re-parole application, we may deny your Form I-765 and will not refund any fees.

While we adjudicate their EAD applications, certain parolees will be able to show their new Form I-94 as acceptable evidence of identity and employment authorization for a period of up to 90 days from the date they are hired (or for reverification, when employment authorization expires).  To be eligible, a parolee must have been:

- Granted re-parole as a certain Ukrainian citizen or an immediate family member;

- Have a most recent date of entry on or before Sept. 30, 2023; and

- Have new I-94 with “UHP” listed as the class of admission.
