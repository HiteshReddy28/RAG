H1: Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization

Alert:Before sending your package to USCIS, make sure that all the forms you have completed are the current acceptable edition. The current acceptable edition can be found under the Edition Date section listed on each form’s webpage.

You can also find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions. For each form that you are submitting, make sure that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are from a different form edition, we may reject your form. WatchUSCIS Forms: Download the most recent version!to see how to ensure your form is acceptable.

For additional guidance on filing paper-based forms at the Lockbox and how to avoid or correct common errors before you file, please visit theFive Steps to File at the USCIS Lockboxwebpage.

If you are permitted to fileForm I-765with another application or petition by mail becauseyour eligibility for employment authorization depends onthe decision or result of that other application or petition, file both forms at the location specified for the other application or petition. For example, if you are filing Form I-765 with Form I-539 or Form I-485 because you need a pending or approved Form I-539 or Form I-485 for approval of your Form I-765, you should file both forms at the location according to the instructions for Form I-539 or Form I-485. See theFiling Form I-765 with Other Formswebpage for more information.

If you are filing Form I-765 at the same time as another application or petition by mail, but your eligibility for employment authorizationdoes not dependon the decision or result of that other application or petition, mail each form in a separate envelope. Do not include the forms in the same envelope. Including unrelated forms in the same envelope may delay processing. Use the information below only when you arenotsubmitting Form I-765 with another application or petition.

If you do not mail your Form I-765 to the appropriate filing location, it may take longer for us to process your application.
