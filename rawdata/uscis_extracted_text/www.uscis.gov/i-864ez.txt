H1: I-864EZ,Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA

ALERT:USCISremindsindividuals who have executed Form I-864EZ that they face serious consequences if the alien they are obligated to support receives means-tested public benefits. Form I-864EZ is a legally binding contract with the U.S. government to financially support the sponsored alien. If a sponsored alien receives means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency can request repayment from the sponsor to recoup the cost of any benefits paid. If the sponsor fails to repay the cost of the means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency may sue the sponsor, who will be liable for the cost of the benefits, legal fees, and other associated costs. Sponsors should not take on this obligation if they are not prepared to follow through on the financial commitment.

Use this form to show that the applying immigrant has adequate means of financial support and is not likely to rely on the U.S. government for financial support.
