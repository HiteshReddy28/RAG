H1: Overseas Processing

Two domestic USCIS field offices oversee all U.S. military Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, applications that service members stationed abroad file. The Guam Field Office oversees adjudications in the Asia/Pacific region. The Washington Field Office oversees adjudications in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions. If you have questions about the processing of Form N-400 for military applicants stationed abroad, visit ourMilitary Help Linepage.

You will still file your form according to the form instructions. The domestic USCIS field office responsible for processing the application (either the Guam or Washington Field Office) will coordinate with the Department of Defense for a video facilitated interview location.

The Department of State provides certain in-person services at U.S. consulates—including accepting Form I-131A, Application for Carrier Documentation—to lawful permanent residents overseas who do not have a valid, unexpired Permanent Resident Card or Reentry Permit (for example, the card or permit was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged). We also have authorized the Department of State to accept certain clearly approvable Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, petitions filed for an immediate relative by a U.S. citizen who meets certain criteria, including where the U.S. citizen is a military service member stationed abroad. However, only USCIS can process naturalization applications.
