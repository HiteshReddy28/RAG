H1: 9.0 Correcting Errors or Missing Information on Form I-9

Employers must ensure that all parts of the Form I-9 are properly competed and may be subject to penalties under federal law if the form is not completed correctly.

If you discover an error or missing information in Section 1 of an employee’s Form I-9, you should ask the employee to correct the error or add the missing information. Only employees, or their preparer and/or translator, may correct errors or omissions made in Section 1.

Have the employee:

- Draw a line through the incorrect information;

- Enter the correct or missing information; and

- Initial and date the correction.

You should attach a written explanation of why information was missing or needed correcting. If the employee’s employment has ended, a signed and dated statement identifying the error or omission attach to the existing form and explain why corrections could not be made, for example, the employee no longer works for you.

If the employee is remotely located, you should develop the appropriate business process to allow them to correct or enter missing information.

H2: Corrections by a Preparer and/or Translator Who Helped with Section 1

Upon discovering an error or missing information, the preparer and/or translator should:

- Draw a line through the incorrect information;

- Enter the correct or missing information; and

- Initial and date the correction;

Or

- Draw a line through the incorrect information;

- Have the employee provide the correct or missing information; and

- Have the employee initial and date the correction.

If the preparer and/or translator is the same person who completed a Preparer and/or Translator Certification block in Supplement A, Preparer and/or Translator Certification for Section 1 when the employee initially completed Form I-9, they should not complete a second certification block. If the preparer and/or translator did not previously complete a certification block, they should:

- Complete a certification block in Supplement A; or

- If a certification block was previously completed by a diﬀerent preparer and/or translator:Enter the new preparer and/or translator information (and indicate “for corrections”) in the next certification block on the Supplement.

- Enter the new preparer and/or translator information (and indicate “for corrections”) in the next certification block on the Supplement.

- Enter the new preparer and/or translator information (and indicate “for corrections”) in the next certification block on the Supplement.

H2: Correcting Section 2 and Supplement B, Reverification and Rehire

Only the employer (or their authorized representative) may make corrections in Section 2 or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehires. If you discover an error or missing information, you should:

- Draw a line through incorrect information;

- Enter the correct or missing information; and

- Initial and date the correction or missing information.

You should attach a written explanation of why information was missing or needed correcting. If you failed to enter the date you completed Section 2 and/or Supplement B, Reverification and Rehires, you should not back date the form. Instead, enter the current date and initial by the date field.

To correct multiple errors in one section, you may redo the section on a new Form I-9 and attach it to the old form. You can also complete a new Form I-9 if it contains substantial errors (such as entire sections that were left blank or you completed Section 2 based on unacceptable documents). You should attach a written explanation to the employee’s Form I-9 describing why you made changes to an existing Form I-9 or why you created a new Form I-9.

If you make any changes on the form, do NOT conceal them by, for example, erasing text or using correction fluid. Doing so may lead to increased liability under federal immigration law. If you made these types of changes, we recommend you attach a signed and dated written explanation for the changes to the Form I-9.

If you use an electronic Form I-9, your audit trail should reflect all corrections and additions made to Sections 1 and 2, and Supplements A and B.
