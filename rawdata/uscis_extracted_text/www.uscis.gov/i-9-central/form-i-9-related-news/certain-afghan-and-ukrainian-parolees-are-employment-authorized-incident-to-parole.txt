Nov. 21, 2022, USCIS announced that Ukrainian and Afghan parolees with certain classes of admission are employment authorized incident to their parole.

- Employees whose unexpired Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, contains a class of admission of UHP or OAR on the document, may present it as an acceptable List A receipt that temporarily shows identity and work authorization for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.

- Employees whose unexpired Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, contains a class of admission of DT issued between February 24, 2022, and September 30, 2023, and indicates Ukraine as the country of citizenship on the document, may present it as an acceptable List A receipt that temporarily shows identity and work authorization for Form I-9.

Within 90 days of hire (or in the case of reverification, the date employment authorization expires), the employee must present either:

- an unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD), or

- an unrestricted Social Security card[1]and a List B identity document from the Form I-9 List of Acceptable Documents.

Individuals who received a Form I-94 at the time of entry into the United States should visitI-94 Websiteto view and print a copy of their I-94.

This policy covers these populations if their parole has not been terminated by DHS.
