U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is funded largely by application and petition fees.  Recognizing that some applicants cannot pay the filing fees, USCIS established a fee waiver process for certain forms and benefit types. Demonstrated inability to pay is the only reason USCIS will approve a fee waiver.

Waiving a fee for one applicant transfers the cost of processing their application to other applicants through higher fees.  Therefore, USCIS carefully considers the merits of each fee waiver request before making a decision.

H3: How do I request a fee waiver?

- Read theinstructions for Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, to see if a fee waiver is available for the form you are filing.

- UseForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiverif possible.  We will also accept a written request.

- File your fee waiver request with the form for which you are requesting the fee waiver.  Do not send a fee waiver request by itself.

Note: You cannot use our e-Filing system to file a form for which you are requesting a fee waiver.  Please file a paper application.

H3: How does USCIS make a decision on a fee waiver request?

To be eligible for a fee waiver, one of the following must be met:

- You or qualified members of your household are currently receiving a means-tested benefit. A means-tested benefit is one for which the individuals’ income/resources determine eligibility and/or the benefit amount.

- Your household income is at or below the 150% poverty levelat the time you file.  Check the current poverty levels for this year at:Form I-912P, HHS Poverty Guidelines for Fee Waiver Requests.

- You are experiencing a financial hardship that prevents you from paying the filing fee, including unexpected medical bills or emergencies.
