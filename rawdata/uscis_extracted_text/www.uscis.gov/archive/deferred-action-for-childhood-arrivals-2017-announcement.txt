H2: Next Steps for Phasing Out DACA

If you currently have DACA, you will be allowed to retain both DACA and your work authorization (EAD) until they expire, unless terminated or revoked.

USCIS will adjudicate, on an individual, case by case basis:

- Properly filed pending DACAinitial requestsand associated EAD applications that USCIS accepted as of Sept. 5, 2017.

- Properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated EAD applications that USCIS accepted as of Sept. 5, 2017.

- Properly filed pendingDACA renewal requestsand associated EAD applications from DACA recipients whose DACA and EAD expire between Sept. 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018, that we accepted on or before Oct. 5, 2017. USCIS will consider DACA requests received from residents of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on a case-by-case basis.
