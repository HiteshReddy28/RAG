Last Reviewed/Updated: 02/17/2022

ALERT: On Feb. 21, 2020, the Supreme Court stayed the statewide injunction issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois affecting Illinois filers. USCIS will implement the Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Final Rule nationwide, including in Illinois, on Feb. 24, 2020. USCIS will apply the Final Rule to all applications and petitions postmarked (or, if applicable, submitted electronically) on or after that date. For applications and petitions that are sent by commercial courier (for example, UPS, FedEx, or DHL), the postmark date is the date reflected on the courier receipt. USCIS will reject any affected application or petition that does not adhere to the Final Rule, including those submitted by or on behalf of aliens living in Illinois, if postmarked on or after Feb. 24, 2020.

The Final Rule requires applicants for adjustment of status who are subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility and certain applicants and petitioners seeking extension of stay and change of status to report certain information related to public benefits. Due to litigation-related delays in the Final Rule’s implementation, USCIS is applying this requirement as though it refers to Feb. 24, 2020, rather than October 15, 2019. Please read all references to Oct. 15, 2019, as though they refer to Feb. 24, 2020.

USCIS will not consider, and applicants for adjustment of status do not need to report, the application for, certification or approval to receive, or receipt of certain previously excluded non-cash public benefits (such as SNAP, most forms of Medicaid, and public housing) before Feb. 24, 2020. Similarly, USCIS will not consider as a heavily weighted negative factor receipt of previously included public benefits (such as SSI and TANF) before Feb. 24, 2020 in a public charge inadmissibility determination. In addition, USCIS will not consider, and applicants and petitioners submitting applications and petitions for extension of stay and change of status do not need to report, the receipt of any public benefits received before Feb. 24, 2020.

Certain classes of aliens are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility (such as refugees, asylees, certain VAWA self-petitioners, U petitioners, and T applicants) and therefore, are not subject to the Final Rule.

USCIS will implement theInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds Final Ruleon Feb. 24, 2020. However, we are prohibited from implementing the final rule in Illinois, where it remains enjoined by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. If the injunction in Illinois is lifted, we will provide additional public guidance.

H2: Effects of Moving in and out of Illinois on Applications and Petitions for Adjustment of Status, Extension of Stay, and Change of Status

DHS will not apply the final rule to an applicant, petitioner or beneficiary for adjustment of status, extension of stay, or change of status whose physical address is in Illinois at any point during the adjudication of the application or petition—as long as USCIS isnotifiedof a bona fide change in the applicant’s, beneficiary’s, or petitioner’s physical address to a location in Illinois before USCIS concludes the adjudication of the relevant application or petition.

In the case of a Form I-129 filed by a petitioner on behalf of a beneficiary, we will consider a change in the petitioner’s/employer’s, or beneficiary’s physical address to a location in Illinois at any point during the adjudication process as long as USCIS is notified of a bona fide change in the applicant’s, beneficiary’s and/or the petitioner’s/employer’s physical address before USCIS concludes the adjudication of the relevant application or petition. To learn more about notifying USCIS of an address change, please see ourchange of address page.

If an applicant or petitioner on a beneficiary’s behalf submits an application or petition while the applicant, petitioner or beneficiary is living in Illinois, but the applicant or petitioner notifies USCIS of a bona fide change in the applicant’s, petitioner’s or beneficiary’s physical address to a different state while the application or petition is pending, the final rule willnotapply to the application or petition.

Likewise, if an applicant or a petitioner on a beneficiary’s behalf submits an application or petition while the applicant, petitioner or beneficiary is living outside of Illinois, but the applicant or petitioner notifies USCIS of a bona fide change in the applicant’s, petitioner’s or beneficiary’s physical address to an Illinois address while the application or petition is pending with USCIS, the final rule will alsonotapply to the applicant.

As with all information provided on an application or petition, in signing the application or petition, the applicant or petitioner is certifying, under penalty of perjury, that the physical address provided on the form is true and correct.
