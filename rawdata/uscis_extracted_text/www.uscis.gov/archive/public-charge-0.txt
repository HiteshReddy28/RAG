The information on this page is out of date. However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.

Alert:On Dec. 23, 2022, the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s (DHS)Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibilityfinal rule will go into effect. This final rule, which waspreviously announced, provides clarity and consistency for noncitizens on how DHS will administer the public charge ground of inadmissibility. The final rule is similar to the 1999 Interim Field Guidance that was in place for two decades before the 2019 final rule, which has not been in effect since March 9, 2021.

The final rule will apply to adjustment of status applications postmarked (or electronically submitted, if applicable) on or after Dec. 23.

On Dec. 19, 2022, USCIS published aPolicy Manual updateto provide guidance to USCIS officers on how to implement this regulation fairly and consistently, and to better inform the public about how the rule will be implemented. Thepolicy guidancewill go into effect on Dec. 23, 2022, and applies prospectively to adjustment of status applications filed (or electronically submitted, if applicable) on or after that date. The policy update will supersede the public charge inadmissibility guidance found in the 1999 Interim Field Guidance, and any related guidance addressing public charge inadmissibility.
