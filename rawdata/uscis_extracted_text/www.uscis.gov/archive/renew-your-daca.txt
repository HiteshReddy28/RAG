H1: Renew Your DACA

The information on this page is out of date. However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.

Important information about DACA requests:In compliance with an order of a United States District Court, effective Dec. 7, 2020, USCIS is:

- Accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect prior to Sept. 5, 2017, and in accordance with the Court’s Dec. 4, 2020, order;

- Accepting DACA renewal requests based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect prior to Sept. 5, 2017, and in accordance with the Court’s Dec. 4, 2020, order;

- Accepting applications for advance parole documents based on the terms of the DACA policy prior to Sept. 5, 2017, and in accordance with the Court’s Dec. 4, 2020, order;

- Extending one-year grants of deferred action under DACA to two years; and

- Extending one-year Employment Authorization Documents under DACA to two years.

USCIS will take appropriate steps to provide evidence of the one-year extensions of deferred action and Employment Authorization Documents under DACA to individuals who were issued documentation on or after July 28, 2020, with a one-year validity period under the defunct policy.

DHS will comply with the order while it remains in effect, but DHS may seek relief from the order.
