The information on this page is out of date. However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.

On April 19, USCIS announced it was redesigning the Permanent Resident Card (also known as a Green Card) and the Employment Authorization Document (EAD) as part of the Next Generation Secure Identification Document Project. USCIS will begin issuing the new cards on May 1, 2017.

Some Green Cards and EADs issued after May 1, 2017, may still display the existing design format as USCIS will continue using existing card stock until current supplies are depleted. Both the existing and the new Green Cards and EADs will remain valid until the expiration date shown on the card.

Both the new and existing versions of the Green Card and EAD are acceptable forForm I-9, Employment Eligibility VerificationandE-Verify. Some older Green Cards do not have an expiration date. These older Green Cards without an expiration date also remain valid.
