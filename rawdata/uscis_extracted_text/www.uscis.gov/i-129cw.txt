The beneficiary may need a visa from the U.S. Department of State if they are found ineligible for a grant of status or a change of status or an extension of stay, or if they travel outside the CNMI.

Please provide a duplicate copy of Form I-129CW and all supporting documentation at the time of filing. Additionally, please provide duplicate copies of all documents sent to USCIS in response to a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny. The duplicate copies will be sent to the U.S. Department of State.We will not make duplicate copies.
