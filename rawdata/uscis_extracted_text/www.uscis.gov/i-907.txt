When requesting premium processing for an eligible form or classification, please submit only one Form I-907 with that one eligible form or classification.

If you are seeking premium processing for a single eligible form, please only submit a single Form I-907 for the form that is eligible for premium processing (such as Form I-140 or I-765). Do not include in your packet Forms I-907 that are unrelated to the form for which you are seeking premium processing. This will delay the processing of your request.

If you are submitting a packet containing concurrently filed and associated forms (such as Forms I-140, I-485, I-765, and I-131) and you are requesting premium processing for any of the eligible forms or classifications included in the packet, please only include a single Form I-907 for each eligible form included in the packet. The inclusion of Forms I-907 for petitions or applications which you might have filed separately will delay the processing of all of the forms included in your submission.

If you are requesting premium processing for an eligible petition or application that you submitted earlier (an upgrade), please include only one Form I-907 for the previously filed petition in your submission. Do not submit multiple or unrelated Forms I-907 in the same envelope. The inclusion of multiple Forms I-907 will delay the processing of your request.

Religious Workers (Form I-129 R-1 classification): Previously, USCIS had required the successful completion of an on-site inspection before a petitioner was eligible to file for premium processing. This is no longer generally the case.
